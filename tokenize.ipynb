      "A steppe is usually covered with grass and shrubs, depending on the season and latitude.\n",
      "The term steppe climate denotes a semi-arid climate, which is encountered in regions too dry to support a forest, but not dry enough to be a desert.\n",
      "Steppes are usually characterized by a semi-arid or continental climate.\n",
      "Extremes can be recorded in the summer of up to  and in winter of down to .\n",
      "Besides this major seasonal difference, fluctuations between day and night are also very great.\n",

      "In Europe, some Mediterranean areas have a steppe-like vegetation, such as central Sicily in Italy, southern Portugal, parts of Greece in the southern Athens area, and central-eastern Spain, especially the southeastern coast (around Murcia), and places cut off from adequate moisture due to rain shadow effects such as Zaragoza.\n",
      "In Asia, a subtropical steppe can be found in semi-arid lands that fringe the Thar Desert of the Indian subcontinent as well as much of the Deccan Plateau  in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats, and the Badia of the Levant.\n",

      "Lilias Skene or Lillias Skein (8 November 1628 – 21 June 1697) was a Scottish Quaker preacher, prophet and poet.\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "She was born in 1628 as Lilias Gillespie, one of eight children born to Lilias née Simson (d. 1627), the daughter of Patrick Simson, the minister of Stirling, and John Gillespie (d. 1627 or c.1647), the minister of Kirkcaldy.\n",
      "Her father's date of death is uncertain, being either around the time of Skene's birth or just after her marriage in 1646.\n",
      "Her brothers included the Church of Scotland ministers Patrick Gillespie, Principal of the University of Glasgow, and George Gillespie, a member of the Westminster Assembly.\n",
      "Marriage and Conversion\n",
      "On 26 August 1646 at Kirkcaldy she married the Aberdeen merchant Alexander Skene (c1621–1694), a magistrate and the author of Memorialls for the Government of the Royall-Burghs in Scotland.\n",
      "From 1649 to 1871 he held various offices in Aberdeen, including Treasurer of the Town Council, Dean of Guild, Baillie and a leading man in the church courts.\n",
      "Moving to Aberdeen to live with her husband, between 1647 and 1669 the couple had ten children, their oldest surviving son being John Skene (c.1649–1690) who was to become Deputy Governor of West Jersey from 1684 to 1687.\n",
      "Skene and her husband were avowed Covenanters (a 17th-century Scottish religious and political movement, who supported a Presbyterian Church of Scotland) who were admired for their deep faith at a time when their strict Presbyterianism was out of favour following the Restoration.\n",
      "In 1669 Skene suddenly converted to Quakerism,  with her husband joining her in 1672.\n",
      "Of this time she wrote, 'It is very well known to all that lived in the place where I sojourned, I was none who conversed with them, I was never at one of their meetings, I never read one of their books', yet she experienced 'that thing the school-men call Immediat Objective Revelation'.\n",
      "While the citizens of Aberdeen knew her as Lilias Gillespie, among the Quaker community she was known by her husband's surname.\n",
      "The Quaker community in Aberdeen was small but became increasingly influential, having Robert Barclay and George Keith in its congregation and Skene was the leading female figure in it, having a position equal to the men when dealing with disciplinary matters, while religious meetings were often held in the Skenes' home.\n",
      "In about 1678 Skene was involved in setting up the first Quaker school in Scotland.\n",
      "Her leadership was much in evidence during the years of persecution of the Quaker community between 1676 and 1679 when every male Quaker in Aberdeen, almost 30 in number including her husband, oldest son and son-in-law, were imprisoned for months or years.\n",
      "The women of the community were not imprisoned and were free to meet and petition for the release of their menfolk.\n",
      "Her searing letter of 31 March 1677 entitled 'Word of Warning to the Magistrates and Inhabitants of Aberdeen' publicly took to task the Magistrates, the ministers and the people of Aberdeen and was published in the local newspapers.\n",
      "In the letter she  mentioned her own preaching 'at severall seasons and in diverse maners I have witnessed' while also condemning the imprisoning of  'honest men that have families wives and children ... in those cold nasty stinking holes where ye have shutt them up, who have been as neatly handled and tenderly educated and as usefull in their generation as any amongst you'.\n",
      "It is likely that in the 1680s she helped her husband write his two manuscript accounts of the history of Quakerism in Aberdeen.\n",
      "Influence\n",
      "In 1676 Robert Barclay persuaded Skene to write to Elisabeth of the Palatinate (1618–1680), the Calvinist cousin of the Stuart kings, in an attempt to convert her.\n",
      "The Quakers hoped Elisabeth would intervene on their behalf with her royal relatives in Britain even though their attempt at evangelising her failed.\n",
      "Barclay introduced Skene to Elisabeth as 'a woman of great experience and tenderness of heart who through great tribulations both of body and mind hath attained the earnest of the Kingdom [but whose] husband and son-in-law are now in Prison'.\n",
      "Skene corresponded with the princess and her companion, Countess Anna Maria van Hoorn, and was invited to visit them at Herford Abbey in Westphalia, where Elisabeth was the Abbess.\n",
      "Skene's letters have not survived but are referred to in correspondence between Barclay and the Princess.\n",
      "The biographer of George Keith says that Skene went with Keith, Barclay, George Fox and William Penn on their tour of the Netherlands and Germany during the summer of 1677.\n",
      "Similarly, Barclay wrote that Skene intended to go but Penn and Fox do not mention her in their writings about the trip, and in a letter written to Skene in 1678 Elisabeth seems to be implying that the two had not actually met, writing: 'I love your upright intention to travail (i.e.\n",
      "toil) in spirit for your friends, though unknown to you'.\n",
      "During the summer of 1677 Skene was actually in London and also found time to visit the philosopher Anne Conway at her home, Ragley Hall in Worcestershire.\n",
      "Conway, a recent convert to Quakerism, was bedridden and Skene befriended her and the two began a correspondence with Skene organising from Aberdeen the hiring of Quaker servants for Conway's home.\n",
      "Later life and writings\n",
      "Skene's letters and poems are among the few writings still extant today of a 17th-century Scottish woman who was not an aristocrat.\n",
      "Her only known publication during her lifetime (in which the author referred to her as Lillias Skein) was 'An Expostulatory Epistle, Directed to Robert Macquare' (1678) included in one of Robert Barclay's works in 1679.\n",
      "Macquare (known today as Robert MacWard) was a Presbyterian dissenter whose hate-filled writings against the Quakers had previously persuaded her husband Alexander Skene to write and print a rebuttal.\n",

      "State Street is a pedestrian zone located in downtown Madison, Wisconsin, United States, near the State Capitol.\n",
      "The road proper extends from the west corner of land comprising the Capitol (on the southwestern edge of the Madison Isthmus, at the corners of Carroll and Mifflin Streets) westward to Lake Street, adjoining the campus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison at Library Mall.\n",
      "History\n",
      "The street was a conventional four-lane undivided road until 1974, when a proposal was passed by the City of Madison to turn it into a pedestrian mall.\n",
      "Construction on that project began in late June, 1974, with an initial estimated completion budget of $15 million.\n",
      "This conversion left the street as a two-lane limited-access road, with extra-wide sidewalks created on both sides of the now-narrower street.\n",
      "The east–west road allows only city buses, fire apparatus, police cars, bicycles, delivery vehicles, and pedestrian traffic.\n",
      "Today, the street hosts a variety of shops, bars, and restaurants and is popular for its small-town appeal, street musicians, jugglers and other types of busking, making it a common tourist attraction.\n",
      "Places of interest on State Street are the Overture Center for the Arts, the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Memorial Library Mall.\n",
      "During the summer of 2020, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused 31 out of the 150 businesses located on State Street to close their doors.\n",
      "Additionally, widespread looting and vandalism occurred on State Street in May and June 2020 as a result of protests and riots related to the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n",
      "An estimated 75 businesses were vandalized and some were looted and robbed causing the Mayor to issue a state of emergency.\n",
      "Just as business owners on State Street began removing boarded up windows and barricades, the Shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha lead to further civil unrest in August and September 2020.\n",
      "Madison police used tear gas to disperse the rioters.\n",
      "A $300,000 fund was established to assist business owners affected by the rioting.\n",
      "Halloween\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the late 1970s, State Street gained recognition as a gathering place for tens of thousands of party-goers from several states on Halloween.\n",
      "Once sponsored by the student government at UW-Madison, the party's popularity waned throughout the 1980s and 1990s until it saw a massive boom in the early 2000s.\n",
      "Since 2006, the State Street Halloween party, as a result of years of riotous behaviors, has become a city sanctioned event called \"Freakfest\" that is now headlined by nationally known musical acts.\n",

      "The Taranaki Flyer was the name given to a passenger train that was operated by the New Zealand Railways Department between Whanganui and New Plymouth from 1926 to 1965.\n",
      "Introduction \n",
      "\n",
      "The primary passenger service on the Marton–New Plymouth Line was the New Plymouth Express between Wellington and New Plymouth.\n",
      "It was augmented by three slower mixed trains that ran south from New Plymouth daily.\n",
      "In 1926, patronage was sufficiently high to justify replacing one of the mixed trains with a dedicated passenger service between New Plymouth and Whanganui.\n",
      "This train came to be known as the Taranaki Flyer.\n",
      "Operation \n",
      "\n",
      "For most of its life, the Taranaki Flyer was a carriage train hauled by steam locomotives, and when it was introduced, it took approximately 4.5 hours to complete its journey.\n",
      "On 31 October 1955, the carriage trains were replaced by more economical railcars.\n",
      "The railcars were of the Standard and 88 seater types of the RM class.\n",

      "524 and the southbound train was no.\n",

      "\n",
      "During the 1950s, the effect of commercial airlines and private cars started to reduce patronage on New Zealand's passenger trains significantly.\n",
      "Although the introduction of railcars prolonged the life of many other provincial services in New Zealand, it was not successful for the Taranaki Flyer.\n",
      "On 7 February 1959, the service ran for the last time.\n",
      "The final train no.\n",

      "It derailed on 16 July 1956 as a result of a washout near Hawera while hauling a freight train from Whanganui to New Plymouth.\n",
      "Both  crew survived, but the locomotive was too expensive to recover and was buried in situ, with the repaired railway embankment built directly over it.\n",
      "The engine lay undisturbed until November 2001, and in 2002 it was salvaged minus tender, which was in poor condition, and taken to Waitara.\n",
      "In 2007, the Taranaki Flyer Society formed to restore the locomotive, and it was transported to the old railway goods shed at Stratford.\n",
      "The Society, however, became low on funds and lost its lease on the shed.\n",
      "It offered the locomotive to other preservation groups and accepted an offer from the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust.\n",

      "Through their production team the Bomb Squad, Public Enemy introduced a densely aggressive sound influenced by free jazz, heavy funk, and musique concrète as a backdrop for lead rapper Chuck D, who employed sociopolitical rhetoric, revolutionary attitudes, and dense vocabulary in his performances.\n",
      "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back charted for 47 weeks on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 42, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA in 1989.\n",
      "The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its production techniques and Chuck D's socially and politically charged lyricism.\n",
      "It also appeared on many publications' year-end top album lists for 1988 and was the runaway choice as the best album of 1988 in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll, a poll of the leading music critics in the US.\n",
      "Since its initial reception, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back has been regarded by music writers and publications as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time.\n",
      "In 2000, it was voted number 92 in Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums, and in 2003, it was ranked number 48 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the highest ranking of all the hip hop albums on the list, and the only one acknowledged in the top 100.\n",
      "In the 2020 version of the same list, the album was ranked number 15, while other hip-hop albums moved into the top 100.\n",
      "Background \n",
      "\n",
      "Public Enemy's 1987 debut album Yo!\n",
      "Bum Rush the Show, while acclaimed by hip hop critics and aficionados, had gone ignored for the most part by the rock and R&B mainstream, selling only 300,000 copies, which was relatively low by the high-selling standards of other Def Jam recording artists such as LL Cool J and Beastie Boys at the time.\n",
      "However, the group continued to tour and record tirelessly.\n",
      "\"On the day that Yo!\n",
      "Bum Rush the Show was released [in the spring of 1987], we was already in the trenches recording Nation of Millions,\" stated lead MC Chuck D.\n",
      "\n",
      "With It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, the group set out to make what they considered to be the hip hop equivalent to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, an album noted for its strong social commentary.\n",
      "As said by Chuck, \"our mission was to kill the 'Cold Gettin' Dumb' stuff and really address some situations.\"\n",
      "In order to ensure that their live shows would be as exciting as those they played in London and Philadelphia, the group decided that the music on Nation of Millions would have to be faster than that found on Yo!\n",
      "Bum Rush the Show.\n",
      "\"Years of saved-up ideas,\" noted Chuck, \"were compiled into one focused aural missile.\"\n",
      "Recording \n",
      "\n",
      "Public Enemy began making the album at Chung King Studios in Manhattan but ran into conflicts with engineers prejudiced against hip hop acts.\n",
      "The group resumed recording at Greene St. Recording where they were more comfortable.\n",
      "Initially, the engineers at Greene Street were also apprehensive about the group but eventually grew to respect their work ethic and seriousness about the recording process.\n",
      "Recorded under the working title Countdown to Armageddon, the group ultimately decided on It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back instead, a line from their first album's song \"Raise the Roof\".\n",
      "The material was recorded in 30 days for an estimated $25,000 in recording costs, due to an extensive amount of preproduction by the group at their Long Island studio.\n",
      "The album was completed in six weeks.\n",
      "\"It was aggressive, race-against-the-clock teamwork, taking chances in sound,\" recalled Chuck D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than touring with the rest of the group, Eric \"Vietnam\" Sadler and Hank Shocklee would stay in the studio and work on material for the Nation of Millions album, so that the music was ready when Chuck D and Flavor Flav returned from tour.\n",
      "When the group began planning the second album, the songs \"Bring the Noise\", \"Don't Believe the Hype\", and \"Rebel Without a Pause\" had already been completed.\n",
      "The latter track was recorded during the group's 1987 Def Jam tour, and the lyrics were written by Chuck D in one day spent secluded at his home.\n",
      "Instead of looping the break from James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\", a commonly used breakbeat in hip hop, \"Rebel Without a Pause\" had Flavor Flav play the beat on the drum machine continuously for the track's duration of five minutes and two seconds.\n",
      "Chuck D later said of his contribution to the track, \"Flavor's timing helped create almost like a band rhythm\".\n",
      "Terminator X, the group's DJ/turntablist, also incorporated a significant element to the track, the renowned transformer scratch, towards its end.\n",
      "Named for its similarity to the sound made by the Autobots in The Transformers, the scratch was developed by DJ Spinbad and popularized by DJ Jazzy Jeff and Cash Money, and Terminator X had honed his take on the scratch on tour.\n",
      "The group was satisfied with its sound after having removed the bass from his section of the track.\n",
      "According to Chuck D, Hank Shocklee made the last call when songs were completed.\n",
      "\"Hank would come up with the final mix because he was the sound master... Hank is the Phil Spector of hip-hop.\n",
      "He was way ahead of his time, because he dared to challenge the odds in sound.\"\n",
      "This was also one of the details which Chuck felt to be unique to the time and recording of the album.\n",
      "\"Once hip-hop became corporate, they took the daredevil out of the artistry.\n",
      "But being a daredevil was what Hank brought to the table.\"\n",
      "It was decided amongst the group that the album should be exactly one hour long, thirty minutes on each side.\n",
      "At the time, audio cassettes were more popular than CDs and the group did not want listeners having to hear dead air for a long time after one-half of the album was finished.\n",
      "The two sides of the album were originally the other way around, the album beginning with \"Show Em Whatcha Got\" which leads into \"She Watch Channel Zero?!\".\n",
      "This instead became the start of side two or the \"Black Side\".\n",
      "Hank Shocklee decided to flip the sides just before the mastering of the album and start the record with Dave Pearce introducing the group during their first tour of England.\n",
      "Music and lyrics \n",
      "\n",
      "Under Hank Shocklee's direction, the Bomb Squad, the group's production team, began to develop a dense and chaotic production style that relied on found sounds and avant-garde noise as much as it did on old-school funk.\n",
      "Along with a varied selection of sampled elements, the tracks feature a greater tempo than those of the group's contemporaries.\n",
      "Music critic Robert Christgau noted these elements and wrote that the Bomb Squad \"juice post-Coleman/Coltrane ear-wrench with the kind of furious momentum harmolodic funk has never dared: the shit never stops abrading and exploding\".\n",
      "As with the group's live performances, Flavor Flav supported Chuck D's politically charged lyrics with \"hype man\" vocals and surrealistic lyrics on the album.\n",
      "On the album's content, music journalist Peter Shapiro wrote \"Droning feedback, occasional shards of rock guitar, and James Brown horn samples distorted into discordant shrieks back the political rhetoric of lead rapper Chuck D and the surreality of Flavor Flav\".\n",
      "Ethnomathematics author Ron Eglash interpreted the album's style and production to be \"massively interconnected political and sonic content\", writing that \"[the Bomb Squad] navigated the ambiguity between the philosophies of sound and voice.\n",
      "Public Enemy's sound demonstrated an integration of lyrical content, vocal tone, sample density and layering, scratch deconstruction, and sheer velocity that rap music has never been able to recapture, and that hip-hop DJs and producers are still mining for gems\".\n",
      "In an interview with the New York Daily News, Shocklee noted that the album's dynamic sound was inspired by Chuck D's rapping prowess, stating \"Chuck's a powerful rapper.\n",
      "We wanted to make something that could sonically stand up to him\".\n",
      "Of his own contributions to its production, Shocklee cited himself as being the arranger and noted that he had \"no interest in linear songs\".\n",
      "When using records for sampling, Shocklee stated that he'd sometimes put them on the ground and stomp on them if they sounded too \"clean.\"\n",
      "Hank referred to Chuck D as being the person who would find all the vocal samples, Eric Sadler as \"the one with the musical talent,\" and noted that his brother, Keith Shocklee, \"knew a lot of the breakbeats and was the sound-effects master.\"\n",
      "Shocklee's sentiments were reinforced by Chuck D while explaining the group's working methods during production.\n",
      "\"Eric was the musician, Hank was the antimusician.\n",
      "Eric did a lot of the [drum] programming, [Hank's brother] Keith was the guy who would bring in the feel.\"\n",
      "For his contributions to the production side, Chuck stated that he \"would scour for vocal samples all over the Earth.\n",
      "I would name a song, tag it, and get the vocal samples.\"\n",
      "Chuck D also noted the productiveness of Sadler and Shocklee's differing approaches to the creative process.\n",
      "\"The friction between Hank and Eric worked very well.\n",
      "Hank would put a twist on Eric's musicianship and Eric's musicianship would put a twist on Hank.\"\n",
      "Some production mistakes were kept for the album.\n",
      "The breakdown in \"Bring the Noise\" in which the kick-drum sample from James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" plays solo was a mistake.\n",
      "Apparently, the wrong sequence came up in the SP1200 sampler and Shocklee decided not only to keep it but to have Chuck rewrite his rhyme to fit the pattern.\n",
      "The album itself was mixed with no automation, instead of being recorded on analog tape and later painstakingly mixed by hand.\n",
      "This is a significant fact due to its nature as being one of the most intricate albums of digitally sampled music.\n",
      "Asked years later if replicating the number of samples used on the album would be possible [due to increased clearance costs for copyrighted material], Hank Shocklee said while possible, it would be far more expensive.\n",
      "Songs \n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the album, Chuck D delivers narratives that are characterized by black nationalist rhetoric and regard topics such as self-empowerment for African Americans, critiques of white supremacy, and challenges to exploitation in the music industry.\n",
      "\"Caught, Can We Get a Witness?\"\n",
      "directly addresses the issue of sampling in hip hop and copyright violation from a perspective that supports the practice and claims entitlement due to \"black ownership of the sounds in the first place\".\n",
      "\"Rebel Without a Pause\" exemplifies the faster tempo that Public Enemy intended for the album, while incorporating a heavy beat and samples of screeching horns, the latter taken from the J.B.'s' \"The Grunt\" (1970).\n",
      "According to Ron Eglash, such effects of sampling exemplify the \"sense of urgency\" given to the messages of the album's tracks, \"to heighten the tension of the mix\", while Chuck D's message is \"one of total resistance that was readily accessible through [...] the confrontational sounds of bass, groove, and noise.\"\n",
      "Lyrically, it eschews the traditional verse/chorus—verse/chorus song structure, with 12 bars of Chuck D's aggressive rapping, punctuated by Flavor Flav's stream of consciousness ad-libs.\n",
      "Public Enemy-biographer Russell Myrie writes of the track's significance, \"It matched 'I Know You Got Soul' in terms of its innovation and its breathtaking quality.\n",
      "It increased the tempo for Public Enemy, something they would do repeatedly during their forthcoming masterpiece [...] The faster tempo was important as it would heighten energy levels at their shows.\n",
      "Most important of all, it sounded fresh.\n",
      "It was some next level hip-hop.\n",
      "Chuck and Hank rightly felt it could stand alongside the best rap records of the time.\"\n",
      "Some of the song titles make reference to other works from popular culture.\n",
      "The title of the song \"Party for Your Right to Fight\" is a rearrangement of the Beastie Boys' 1987 hit single \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\"\n",
      "The vocal sample of hip hop DJ Mr. Magic stating that his show would play \"no more music by the suckers\" was used on the song \"Cold Lampin' with Flavor\" after having been recorded from Magic's radio show by Flavor Flav.\n",
      "Magic had dissed the group with the line when he mistakenly embroiled them in the WBAU-WBLS radio war.\n",
      "Chuck D has said that \"Party for Your Right to Fight\", the album's closing track, is dedicated to the Black Panther Party.\n",
      "Release and reception \n",
      "The album was released on June 28, 1988 and in its first month of release, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back sold 500,000 copies without significant promotional efforts by its distributing label Columbia Records.\n",
      "It peaked at number 42 on the U.S.\n",
      "Billboard Top Pop Albums chart and at number one on the Top Black Albums chart.\n",
      "It spent 49 weeks on the Billboard Top Pop Albums.\n",
      "On August 22, 1989, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of at least one million copies in the United States.\n",
      "Since 1991, when the tracking system Nielsen SoundScan began tracking domestic sales data, the album has sold 722,000 additional copies .\n",
      "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back received positive reviews from contemporary critics.\n",
      "In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described the album as a \"Molotov cocktail of nuclear scratching, gnarly minimalist electronics and revolution rhyme\" and complimented its \"abrupt sequencing and violent sonic compression of rapid-fire samples, slamming-jail-door percussion, DJ Terminator X's tornado turntable work and Chuck D's outraged oratory\".\n",
      "Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn said that the album incorporates some of the dynamics of early rap records such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \"The Message\" (1982) and Run–D.M.C.\n",
      "'s \"Sucker M.C.\n",
      "'s\" (1983) with the \"radical, socially conscious tradition of groups like the Last Poets\".\n",
      "Hilburn commended Chuck D for his rapping on It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, writing that he \"isn't afraid of being labeled an extremist, and it's that fearless bite—or game plan—that helps infuse his black-consciousness raps with the anger and assault of punk pioneers like the Sex Pistols and Clash\".\n",
      "Writing for NME, critic James Brown said that \"Nation of Millions... is impressive because it moves, it uses and it's a music—not the acetate-thin barrage of whingeing and boasting that so often passes for rap\", while in Q, David Sinclair called it \"an unimaginably urgent album seething with vengeful rage and booby trapped with incendiary musical devices\".\n",
      "Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the album for its production and compared its symbolic value to hip hop music at the time, stating:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite writing that it \"sounds powerful, fresh and galvanizing\", Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post found its lyrical content inconsistent, stating \"Aurally, Nation of Millions is intoxicating; Hank Shocklee and Carl Ryder's bold production will likely prove among the most distinctive of the year, not just in rap but in any pop genre.\n",
      "For their work to pack the political wallop they crave, however, the members of Public Enemy need to think for themselves, not just attach themselves to the thought of whichever black nationalist is currently drawing big crowds\".\n",
      "The Los Angeles Daily News gave the album a \"B\" and compared its musical \"rage\" to that of rapper Schoolly D's Smoke Some Kill (1988).\n",
      "In its year-end list of 1988's best albums, Q called It Takes a Nation \"a blistering collage of beat box [sic], rock guitar, police-radio chatter and high-velocity rapping.\"\n",
      "It was voted number one in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll, as well as number three on poll creator Robert Christgau's list.\n",
      "In an article for the newspaper, Christgau called it \"the bravest and most righteous experimental pop of the decade—no matter how the music looks written down (ha ha), Hank Shocklee and Terminator X have translated Blood Ulmer's harmolodic visions into a street fact that's no less edutaining (if different) in the dwellings of monkey spawn and brothers alike (and different)\".\n",
      "Legacy and influence \n",
      "\n",
      "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back has been cited by critics and publications as one of the greatest and most influential recordings of all time.\n",
      "Upon the album's remastered reissue in 1995, Q hailed it \"the greatest rap album of all time, a landmark and classic\".\n",
      "Melody Maker called the album \"bloody essential\", commenting, \"I hadn't believed it could get harder [than Yo!\n",
      "Bum Rush the Show].\n",
      "Or better.\"\n",
      "NME dubbed it \"the greatest hip-hop album ever\" at the time, stating \"this wasn't merely a sonic triumph.\n",
      "This was also where Chuck wrote a fistful of lyrics that promoted him to the position of foremost commentator/documentor of life in the underbelly of the USA\".\n",
      "Readers of Hip Hop Connection voted it the best album of all-time, prompting the magazine to comment, \"Even 'Rebel Without a Pause', a definite contender for best rap single ever released, failed to put the other 12 [sic] tracks to shame, such was the high standard throughout.\"\n",
      "HHC readers again voted it the best of all-time in 2000, as did Flavor Flav in his accompanying top ten.\n",
      "\"This is really hard,\" he said, \"because I'm in love with every piece of work that's ever been recorded.\n",
      "I would never say someone else's project is better than anyone else's.\"\n",
      "Mojo stated upon the album's 2000 European reissue, \"Responsible for the angriest polemic since The Last Poets....[they] revolutionized the music, using up to 80 backing tracks in the sonic assault....to these ears PE sound like the greatest rock'n'roll band in history\".\n",
      "In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 48 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, making it the highest-ranked of the 27 hip hop albums included on the list, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.\n",
      "Time magazine hailed it as one of the 100 greatest albums of all time in 2006.\n",
      "Kurt Cobain, the lead guitarist and singer of rock band Nirvana, listed the album as one of his top 50 favorite albums in his Journals.\n",
      "In 2006, Q placed the album at number seven on its list of \"40 Best Albums of the '80s\".\n",
      "As of July 2014, It Takes a Nation of Millions is ranked as the top album of 1988 and the eighteenth greatest album of all time at Acclaimed Music.\n",
      "In 2012, Slant Magazine listed the album at #3 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\" behind Michael Jackson's Thriller and Prince and the Revolution's Purple Rain.\n",
      "The album ranks Number 2 on the list of best records of the 20th century of German music magazine Spex.\n",
      "In his 2004 book Appropriating Technology: Vernacular Science and Social Power, Ron Eglash commented that a sonically and politically charged album such as Nation \"can be considered a monument to the synthesis of sound and politics\".\n",
      "In 2005, New York University's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music hosted a two-day retrospective called \"The Making of It Takes a Nation of Millions.\"\n",
      "It featured a producers' panel that reunited Hank Shocklee, captain of the Bomb Squad, with the Chairmen of the Boards from Greene St. Recording.\n",
      "When asked in 2008 if the album would still be considered as radical if it were released two decades later, Chuck D said he felt it would \"simply because it's faster than anything on the radio right now.\n",
      "And yeah, it's radical politically... because it's not really being said a lot.\n",
      "You want it to not be radical, but it is because it's totally different from Soulja Boy.\"\n",
      "American rapper Ice Cube said in 2005 that the album \"messes with your brain even to this day.\"\n",
      "The album's revolutionary attitudes also influenced musician and activist Kathleen Hanna of the seminal riot grrrl band Bikini Kill.\n",
      "She described it as her go-to album while touring, stating: \"I was like, 'Man, some of these rappers are bragging and boasting, and I wanna brag and boast!'\n",
      "Like, why do I feel like I have to try to write the song I'm supposed to write, and not the song I wanna write?\"\n",
      "Public Enemy performed the album in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.\n",
      "\"I didn't think it would work,\" Chuck D admitted of the full-length performance.\n",
      "\"But it ended up being something that worked tremendously well.\n",
      "Now we have a problem to get away from it.\n",
      "It amazed me that a lot of people who have gravitated to the album weren't even born when it was recorded.\n",
      "But it's YouTube and iLike and MySpace and file sharing which highlighted the existence of it.\n",
      "So I can't shoot down file sharing, as it's benefited us tremendously.\"\n",
      "Music from the album has been sampled over the years, including (though not limited to) the Beastie Boys (\"Egg Man\"), Game (\"Remedy\"), The album is broken down track-by-track by Chuck D in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique.\n",

      "In addition to the above, most of his recent significant research contributions are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Photonic Crystal based nanophotonic devices: Photonic crystals are periodic dielectric structures that have a band gap that forbids propagation of a certain frequency range of light.\n",
      "This property enables one to control light with amazing facility and produce effects that are impossible with conventional optics.\n",
      "Various new design of photonic crystal made of silicon on insulator (SOI) is proposed for design and development of photonic crystal based coupler, Y splitter, Dual band wavelength multiplexor and de-multiplexors.\n",
      "A new design of Super polarizer is also proposed and its degree of polarization and fabrication tolerance were also estimated.\n",
      "This was followed by the design of photonic crystal structure for slow light generation leading to formation of soliton at incredibly low power, design of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexor (DWDM) and de-multiplexore for telecom application.\n",
      "Metamaterials and Negative refraction:  A new structure of exhibiting negative refraction (called metamaterial) is designed, analyzed, fabricated and experimentally characterized.\n",
      "This was experimentally realized using V-shaped split ring resonator made up of two dimensional arrays of 50 nanometer thick gold on n-doped silicon substrate.\n",
      "It is shown that by changing the angular gap of V- shaped SRRs, it is possible to tune the electromagnetic parameters (such as dielectric permitivity, permeability and refractive index) and control the flow of light for design and development of metamaterial based optical switches and sensors at nano-scale.\n",
      "In addition, left handed (metamaterials exhibiting negative refraction) metallo-dielectric photonic crystal exhibiting All Angle Negative Refraction for visible light is analyzed with detailed theoretical and numerical demonstration for the first time.\n",
      "On the same line another new design of left handed metamaterial structure is analyzed and proposed for generation of ultra violet light via second harmonic generation.\n",
      "Here, it is shown that negative index is achieved by excitation of Surface Plasmon Polariton waves operating in dispersion regime with anti parallel refracted wave vector and the Poynting vector.\n",
      "Plasmonics & Plasmonic Bandgap Engineering: Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic waves guided along metal dielectric interfaces resulting from the interaction of incident photon with that of collective electron oscillation in metals.\n",
      "SPPs have shorter wavelength than that of incident photons and hence provide strong spatial confinement with promising application in the design and development of sub nano-scale devices.\n",
      "A new concept of Plasmonic Band Gap engineering is highlighted and used for SPP propagation leading to formation of Plasmonic Waveguides.\n",
      "Several types of plasmonic waveguides exhibiting superior propagation characteristics were designed leading to proposal of a new design of Plasmonic Mach-Zhender Interferrometer (PMZI) sensor.\n",
      "It is shown that proposed PMZI has very high sensitivity of the order of 6000 nm/RIU, which has been effectively used for label free classification and detection of cancer cell.\n",
      "Field Emission characteristics of Carbon Nanotube (CNT) & Nano-Bio Sensors: CNTs were grown using Inconel and silicon substrates and their field emission characteristics have been studied with a view of their promising applications for next generation high performance flat panel devices.\n",
      "Later field emission with ultralow turn on voltage (of the order 0.1 volt/µm) from metal decorated CNTs have been obtained.\n",
      "A single-step method for synthesis and deposition of gold nanostructures was developed for fabrication of a highly sensitive and selective cholesterol nano-biosensor.\n",
      "Using electrochemical synthesis and assembly of gold nanostructures high performance electrochemical biosensor is fabricated which can be utilized for healthcare diagnostic applications.\n",
      "Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) & Supercontinuum generation: Prof. Sinha developed several analytical and numerical techniques for studying light wave propagation characteristics through specially designed photonic crystal fibers and developed experimental techniques for their characterization which have become topic of various text and reference books these days and very well cited by research community.\n",
      "Application specific photonic crystal fibers like large mode area PCF and Triangular core PCF were also designed.\n",
      "Very recently, a new design of PCF called Triangular Core Graded Index PCF were designed and analyzed for ultra broad band ( i.e.\n",

      "WSMC has only three full-time employees: the general manager, corporate sales manager, and operations manager.\n",
      "The announcers and production staff consist entirely of SAU students.\n",
      "WSMC-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, currently the maximum power for American FM stations.\n",
      "Programming can also be heard on FM translator W217AW at 91.3 MHz in Dalton, Georgia.\n",
      "History\n",
      "\n",
      "Early years\n",
      "In , WSMC-FM first signed on the air.\n",
      "Originally on 88.1 FM, it moved to 90.7 in 1967 and to 90.3 in 1990.\n",
      "For years, its signal was spotty at best in downtown Chattanooga.\n",
      "However, in 1990, it moved from its original tower on White Oak Mountain to a new tower on Mowbray Mountain in Soddy-Daisy, allowing it better coverage of the Chattanooga radio market.\n",
      "The call sign stands for Southern Missionary College, SAU's name at the time the station began operations.\n",
      "Religious programming controversies\n",
      "In 1971, WSMC became one of the charter members of NPR.\n",
      "However, because of the religious doctrine of the licensee's church body, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, WSMC cannot air live news programming from sunset on Friday evening until sunset on Saturday evening.\n",
      "This frequently resulted in NPR's afternoon drive time program, All Things Considered, being interrupted in progress.\n",
      "That situation did not sit well with NPR during the 1990s.\n",
      "Coinciding with this dispute, a citizens' group called \"Chattanoogans for Better Public Radio\" took exception to what group organizer Bob Steverson described as the \"awkward marriage of convenience\" between WSMC and NPR.\n",
      "Most of NPR's funding comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, itself subsidized by Federal appropriations.\n",
      "From sunset on Friday evening to sunset on Saturday evening, WSMC aired a variety of local and national religious programs.\n",
      "The groups complained that it was inappropriate for WSMC to receive federal funding, since it aired more religious programming each week than could be considered a public service.\n",
      "Some individuals also alleged that the religious programming, mandated by the administration of what was then Southern College of Seventh-day Adventists, amounted to catering to a religious minority at the expense of the larger public in the Tennessee Valley.\n",
      "In March 1995, WSMC formed a community advisory board to address these concerns.\n",
      "However, as Steverson's group saw it, Southern College had three options:  stop preempting NPR programming, move NPR programming to the area's other NPR member station, WUTC, or give up its license to another owner.\n",
      "In June 1995, NPR officials began the process of terminating WSMC's membership on the grounds that the station preempted NPR programming too often and aired too much religious programming.\n",
      "In response, college officials and station management decided to take action themselves, discontinuing most NPR programming, news included, taking effect on September 30, 1995.\n",
      "Replacing ATC were Public Radio International's The World and American Public Media's Marketplace, which could air on a delayed basis or be preempted on Fridays.\n",
      "A few NPR programs remained on the schedule (purchased separately without a network discount).\n",
      "Most of the other programs moved to WUTC, which replaced WSMC as the Chattanooga market's primary NPR station.\n",
      "WSMC has since dropped most NPR programming from its schedule, though it does still air some NPR news updates.\n",
      "Programming\n",
      "Except for the religious shows on Friday evenings and in the daytime on Saturdays (the 24-hour period of observance for Seventh-day Adventists), WSMC's programming consists entirely of classical music and derived genres.\n",
      "WSMC is less diverse than a typical public radio station, targeting an older, more conservative listenership.\n",
      "By contrast, 88.1 WUTC carries mostly news and talk programs furnished by NPR and other public radio suppliers.\n",
      "Some national classical shows from NPR and other programming sources includes Performance Today, From the Top, Pipedreams\n",

      "He was a son of the famous Texas hero and statesman Sam Houston and his wife Margaret Lea Houston, and was named for his father's mentor Andrew Jackson.\n",
      "He served briefly as a United States senator in 1941, appointed to temporarily fill the vacancy left by the death of longtime Senator Morris Sheppard.\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "Andrew J. Houston was born in Independence, Texas, on June 21, 1854.\n",
      "He was educated at several military academies and colleges, including Baylor University and West Point—a member of the Class of 1875, he dropped out before graduating.\n",
      "He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1876.\n",
      "Career\n",
      "Houston had a varied career, including serving as clerk of the federal court in Dallas, a colonel in the Texas National Guard and United States Marshal for the eastern district of Texas.\n",
      "Houston ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Texas in 1892 as a lily-white Republican candidate.\n",
      "During the Spanish–American War Houston raised and organized a cavalry troop which was mustered into service as part of the Rough Riders.\n",
      "In 1910 and 1912 he was a Prohibition Party candidate for Governor.\n",
      "A longtime resident of La Porte, in 1918 he retired to study and write history.\n",
      "From 1924 until his Senate appointment he held a sinecure as Superintendent of the state park at the San Jacinto battleground, where his father had won the battle which led to the independence of Texas from Mexico.\n",
      "United States senator \n",
      "\n",
      "Houston's semi-retirement ended in 1941, when John Morris Sheppard died while representing Texas in the United States Senate.\n",
      "Texas Governor W. Lee O'Daniel desired to serve in the Senate, but knew it would be politically unpopular to name himself as the interim appointee pending a special election for the remainder of Sheppard's term.\n",
      "Certain that the 86-year-old Houston would not run in the special election, O'Daniel appointed him to temporarily fill the vacancy.\n",
      "At the time of his swearing in, 82 years after his father had served in the same seat, Houston was the oldest man to enter the Senate.\n",
      "(The oldest person was Rebecca Latimer Felton).\n",
      "Houston joined the Senate as a Democrat, and filled the seat from April 21, 1941, until his death.\n",
      "The early June trip from Texas to Washington, D.C., to begin his duties had a negative effect on Houston's health, and he attended only one committee meeting as a senator, afterwards spending most of his time hospitalized.\n",
      "Death and burial\n",
      "Houston died in a Baltimore, Maryland, hospital on June 26, 1941, five days after his 87th birthday.\n",
      "Houston was briefly interred at Abbey Mausoleum in Arlington County, Virginia.\n",
      "He was later disinterred and reburied in the Texas State Cemetery.\n",
      "Legacy\n",
      "In the special election held a few days after Houston's death, O'Daniel defeated Lyndon B. Johnson and several other candidates, and won the seat.\n",
      "Houston is one of 4 Senators (the others being William Johnson, Edmund Pettus and Strom Thurmond) to be the oldest living U.S. senator while serving and he is the only Senator subsequent to the second U.S. Congress to become the oldest living Senator upon entering office.\n",
      "Family\n",
      "Houston was married twice; his first wife was Carrie Glenn Purnell of Austin, who died in 1884.\n",
      "His second wife, Elizabeth Hart Goode of Dallas died in 1907.\n",
      "Houston was the father of three daughters, Ariadne, Marguerite, and Josephine;  Ariadne and Marguerite largely devoted their adult lives to caring for their father.\n",
      "Both Ariadne and Marguerite traveled with him to Washington after his Senate appointment, and they were with him when he died.\n",

      "Biography\n",
      "Kuo was born in Shanghai, Jiangsu province, and his father was an elder in the Presbyterian Church.\n",
      "He attended Lowrie Institute (The Pure Heart Academy, Qingxin Shuyuan 清心書院), which was connected with the First Presbyterian Church in Shanghai (founded by John Marshall Willoughby Farnham, 1830–1917), graduating in 1896.\n",
      "Kuo Ping-wen then served in the customs and postal bureaus before coming to the United States in 1906 under the sponsorship of the Presbyterian Church, at first attending the Preparatory Academy at the University of Wooster, now the College of Wooster, in Ohio, and later, in 1908, matriculating at the University of Wooster with the support of the Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program.\n",
      "At Wooster, Kuo was one of the editors of the university newspaper, The Wooster Voice, and General Secretary of the Chinese Students Alliance.\n",
      "In 1911 he wrote an extensive article for the newspaper on the history of Chinese students in the United States, beginning with Yung Wing (Rong Hong) 容閎 at Yale University in the mid-nineteenth century.\n",
      "He won several speech prizes for the university and was mentored in oratory by Professor of Speech Delbert Lean.\n",
      "He graduated with honors from the University of Wooster in 1911 and then undertook graduate studies in Education under John Dewey and Paul Monroe at Columbia University, where he received his M.A.\n",
      "degree in 1912 and his Ph.D. in 1914.\n",
      "His doctoral dissertation, The Chinese System of Public Education, was published by the Teachers College at Columbia in 1915 and is a wide-ranging study of the history and structural development of education in China from ancient times onward.\n",
      "The Chinese edition of the book was published in Shanghai in 1916.\n",
      "In 1914 Kuo returned to China where he transformed the Nanjing Higher Normal School ( Nanjing Gaodeng Shifan Xuexiao 南京高等师范学校) into the first modern co-educational Chinese University, National Southeastern University (Guoli Dongnan Daxue 国立东南大学), which was later renamed National Central University (Guoli Zhongyang Daxue 国立中央大学) in 1928 and Nanjing University (Nanjing Daxue 南京大学) in 1949, and his ideas exerted a broad influence in Chinese educational circles.\n",
      "In 1921, he became the first chancellor of the Shanghai College of Commerce (Shanghai Shangke Daxue上海商科大学), which in 1917 had emerged from the program in commerce at Nanjing Higher Normal School.\n",
      "The Shanghai College of Commerce was the forerunner of the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) (Shanghai Caijing Daxue 上海财经大学).\n",
      "Kuo was the president of National Nanjing Higher Normal School from 1919-1923 and National Southeastern University from 1921-1925.\n",
      "Kuo Ping-wen was elected three times as Vice-Chairman of the World Education Congress (Shijie Jiaoyuhui 世界教育會) and became the Chairman of its Asian division in 1923.\n",
      "His removal from his presidential post at National Southeastern University in 1925 was a result of the intrusion of political forces into higher education and academia during the turbulent decade of the 1920s in China.\n",
      "Essentially, Kuo had made compromises with the warlords during that decade in order to develop National Southeastern University, and the rise of the Kuomintang set him at odds with the Nationalist leadership.\n",
      "Later on in 1925, he came to the United States to lecture at the University of Chicago and was one of the founders of the China Institute in New York City, and also its Director, 1926-1930.\n",
      "He married Ruth How, Xia Yu 夏瑜, on October 12, 1935 in Hangzhou.\n",
      "During the Second World War, Kuo was stationed in London with the Chinese Embassy and then returned to the United States as a member of the Chinese delegation associated with the early formation of the United Nations.\n",
      "He was instrumental in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 and served as the deputy director of the United Nations Relief Rehabilitation Administration.\n",
      "In the last decade of his life, he was President of the Sino-American Cultural Society in Washington, D.C., an organization he founded in 1958.\n",
      "Kuo Ping-wen is buried in Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Maryland.\n",
      "Legacy\n",
      "\n",
      "In June 2011, the 100th anniversary of Kuo's graduation from the University of Wooster, and ninety years after Kuo was appointed as President of National Southeastern University, a conference examining Kuo's contribution to higher education in China was held in Nanjing at Southeast University, the site of former Southeastern University which Kuo had helped found.\n",
      "Scholars from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, and the United States were represented, and the participants presented papers dealing with Kuo's educational thought, his ideas on structuring higher education in China, and his impact on relations between East and West.\n",
      "On October 25, 2014, a symposium was held at Columbia University Teachers College dealing with Kuo's contributions to higher education in China and to Sino-Cultural institutions and affairs in the United States.\n",
      "Scholars from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China and the United States contributed papers and participated in discussions on Kuo's career and its significance.\n",
      "In March, 2016, the book Kuo Ping Wen: Scholar, Reformer, Statesman, a collection of essays on Kuo as educator, statesman, and cultural ambassador, edited by Ryan Allen and Ji Liu, was published by Long River Press, and in October, 2016 a book-signing symposium was held at the C.V. Starr East Asian Library at Columbia University.\n",
      "Since his academic background was shaped at liberal arts institutions, Kuo believed that a well-rounded education in both the sciences and the humanities was essential.\n",
      "Moreover, since his undergraduate experience at the University of Wooster was co-educational, he was a strong supporter of women's education in China.\n",
      "It was at the University of Wooster that Kuo changed his plan to study law and focused instead on issues of educational reform, which became the basis for his career once he returned to China.\n",
      "His educational philosophy embraced a strategy based on Four Balances: the balance between well-rounded education and specialized education, the balance between humanistic education and scientific education, the balance between investment in teaching faculty and investment in teaching facilities, and the balance between national and international learning.\n",
      "Kuo felt that China could learn much from the study of Western accomplishments in science, just as the West could learn much from China about the philosophy of life, and he was a strong supporter of the expansion of Chinese studies at American colleges and universities.\n",
      "In furthering interactions between East and West through education, Kuo Ping-wen contributed to building the Sino-American relationship that flourishes today.\n",

      "He broke the pole vault world record in 1932 and competed at the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, placing fourth and fifth, respectively.\n",
      "Athletic career\n",
      "\n",
      "Graber studied at the University of Southern California (USC), where he was coached by Dean Cromwell.\n",
      "As a sophomore in 1931 Graber won the pole vault at the IC4A championships and tied for first at the NCAA championships, helping the USC Trojans to team titles in both meets.\n",
      "At the IC4A meet in Philadelphia men's pole vault was the last event and Graber's meeting record of 14 ft  in (4.28 m) secured the Trojans a narrow victory over Stanford University.\n",
      "Graber was only the fifth athlete in the world to jump 14 feet or more in a competition, and the only one to do so that year.\n",
      "Graber's NCAA jump of 13 ft  in (4.22 m) was also a meeting record; the Trojans won that team title by a much more comfortable margin, scoring a record  points and beating Ohio State by 46 points.\n",
      "Graber repeated as IC4A champion 1932, although this time he only tied for first.\n",
      "He was unable to defend his NCAA title as the Trojans didn't compete in that meet.\n",
      "The American team for the Olympics in Los Angeles was selected at the Olympic Trials in Palo Alto, with the top three qualifying.\n",
      "Both Graber and Stanford's Bill Miller cleared 14 ft  in (4.31 m), a fraction of an inch better than Lee Barnes's world record of 14 ft  in (4.30 m).\n",
      "Graber then cleared 14 ft  in (4.37 m) to obliterate the record; he said afterwards \"it was the first time this year that I have been able to follow one good vault with another.\"\n",
      "The record established Graber as the leading favorite for the Olympics, but he underperformed and only jumped 13 ft  in (4.15 m), placing fourth behind Miller, Japan's Shuhei Nishida and the other American entrant, George Jefferson.\n",
      "Graber won his third IC4A title in 1933 in a five-way tie for first place.\n",
      "He also tied for first place at the NCAA meet, jumping 13 ft  in (4.24 m) to break his own meeting record.\n",
      "In 1934 he was national champion indoors and tied for the title outdoors.\n",
      "He almost broke his own world record in April 1935 at Santa Barbara, clearing a bar supposedly at 14 ft  in (4.41 m), but it was subsequently found that the take-off point had been two inches (5 cm) higher than the point of measurement and the record could not be ratified.\n",
      "Entering the Olympic year of 1936, Graber was considered a leading candidate for his second Olympic Games.\n",

      "In political science, sultanism is a form of authoritarian government characterized by the extreme personal presence of the ruler in all elements of governance.\n",
      "The ruler may or may not be present in economic or social life, and thus there may be pluralism in these areas, but this is never true of political power.\n",
      "The term sultanism is derived from sultan, a title used in Muslim societies for a secular sovereign or monarch, often in contrast with the religious title of caliph.\n",
      "In modern scholarly usage, sultanism is not limited to Muslim or Middle Eastern societies.\n",
      "In 1996, Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan listed the clearest examples of sultanism as \"Haiti under the Duvaliers, the Dominican Republic under Trujillo, the Central African Republic under Bokassa, the Philippines under Marcos, Romania under Ceauşescu, and North Korea under Kim Il Sung\".\n",
      "According to Linz and Stepan: [T]he essential reality in a sultanistic regime is that all individuals, groups and institutions are permanently subject to the unpredictable and despotic intervention of the sultan, and thus all pluralism is precarious\n",
      "\n",
      "In sultanism, the sultan may or may not adopt a ruling ideology, but he is never bound by any rules or given ideology, even his own.\n",
      "The sultan may also use whatever forces he can to exercise his personal will, such as para-militaries or gangs as stated by Max Weber in Economy and Society: [I]n the extreme case, Sultanism tend[s] to arise whenever traditional domination develops an administration and a military force which are purely instruments of the master.\n",
      "[...] Where domination [...] operates primarily on the basis of discretion, it will be called sultanism.\n",
      "[...] The non-traditional element is not, however, rationalized in impersonal terms, but consists only in the extreme development of the ruler's discretion.\n",

      "A blacksmith is a metalsmith who creates objects primarily from wrought iron or steel, but sometimes from other metals, by forging the metal, using tools to hammer, bend, and cut (cf.\n",
      "tinsmith).\n",
      "Blacksmiths produce objects such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons.\n",
      "There was an historical distinction between the heavy work of the blacksmith and the more delicate operation of a whitesmith, who usually worked in gold, silver, pewter, or the finishing steps of fine steel.\n",
      "The place where a blacksmith works is called variously a smithy, a forge or a blacksmith's shop.\n",
      "While there are many people who work with metal such as farriers, wheelwrights, and armorers, in former times the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things, from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain.\n",
      "Etymology\n",
      "The \"black\" in \"blacksmith\" refers to the black firescale, a layer of oxides that forms on the surface of the metal during heating.\n",
      "The origin of smith is the Old English word smið meaning \"blacksmith\", originating from the Proto-Germanic *smithaz meaning \"skilled worker.\"\n",
      "Smithing process\n",
      "\n",
      "Blacksmiths work by heating pieces of wrought iron or steel until the metal becomes soft enough for shaping with hand tools, such as a hammer, an anvil and a chisel.\n",
      "Heating generally takes place in a forge fueled by propane, natural gas, coal, charcoal, coke, or oil.\n",
      "Some modern blacksmiths may also employ an oxyacetylene or similar blowtorch for more localized heating.\n",
      "Induction heating methods are gaining popularity among modern blacksmiths.\n",
      "Color is important for indicating the temperature and workability of the metal.\n",
      "As iron heats to higher temperatures, it first glows red, then orange, yellow, and finally white.\n",
      "The ideal heat for most forging is the bright yellow-orange color that indicates forging heat.\n",
      "Because they must be able to see the glowing color of the metal, some blacksmiths work in dim, low-light conditions, but most work in well-lit conditions.\n",
      "The key is to have consistent lighting, but not too bright.\n",
      "Direct sunlight obscures the colors.\n",
      "The techniques of smithing can be roughly divided into forging (sometimes called \"sculpting\"), welding, heat-treating, and finishing.\n",
      "Forging\n",
      " \n",
      "Forging—the process smiths use to shape metal by hammering—differs from machining in that forging does not remove material.\n",
      "Instead, the smith hammers the iron into shape.\n",
      "Even punching and cutting operations (except when trimming waste) by smiths usually re-arrange metal around the hole, rather than drilling it out as swarf.\n",
      "Forging uses seven basic operations or techniques:\n",
      "\n",
      " Drawing down\n",
      " Shrinking (a type of upsetting)\n",
      " Bending\n",
      " Upsetting\n",
      " Swaging\n",
      " Punching\n",
      " Forge welding\n",
      "\n",
      "These operations generally require at least a hammer and anvil, but smiths also use other tools and techniques to accommodate odd-sized or repetitive jobs.\n",
      "Drawing\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing lengthens the metal by reducing one or both of the other two dimensions.\n",
      "As the depth is reduced, or the width narrowed, the piece is lengthened or \"drawn out.\"\n",
      "As an example of drawing, a smith making a chisel might flatten a square bar of steel, lengthening the metal, reducing its depth but keeping its width consistent.\n",
      "Drawing does not have to be uniform.\n",
      "A taper can result as in making a wedge or a woodworking chisel blade.\n",
      "If tapered in two dimensions, a point results.\n",
      "Drawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods.\n",
      "Two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn, and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer.\n",
      "Another method for drawing is to use a tool called a fuller, or the peen of the hammer, to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal.\n",
      "(The technique is called fullering from the tool.)\n",
      "Fullering consists of hammering a series of indentations with corresponding ridges, perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn.\n",
      "The resulting effect looks somewhat like waves along the top of the piece.\n",
      "Then the smith turns the hammer over to use the flat face to hammer the tops of the ridges down level with the bottoms of the indentations.\n",
      "This forces the metal to grow in length (and width if left unchecked) much faster than just hammering with the flat face of the hammer.\n",
      "Bending \n",
      "\n",
      "Heating iron to a \"forging heat\" allows bending as if it were a soft, ductile metal, like copper or silver.\n",
      "Bending can be done with the hammer over the horn or edge of the anvil or by inserting a bending fork into the hardy hole (the square hole in the top of the anvil), placing the work piece between the tines of the fork, and bending the material to the desired angle.\n",
      "Bends can be dressed and tightened, or widened, by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil.\n",
      "Some metals are \"hot short\", meaning they lose their tensile strength when heated.\n",
      "They become like Plasticine: although they may still be manipulated by squeezing, an attempt to stretch them, even by bending or twisting, is likely to have them crack and break apart.\n",
      "This is a problem for some blade-making steels, which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that would cause failure in the future.\n",
      "Though rarely hand-worked, titanium is notably hot short.\n",
      "Even such common smithing processes as decoratively twisting a bar are impossible with it.\n",
      "Upsetting \n",
      "Upsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other.\n",
      "One form is to heat the end of a rod and then hammer on it as one would drive a nail: the rod gets shorter, and the hot part widens.\n",
      "An alternative to hammering on the hot end is to place the hot end on the anvil and hammer on the cold end.\n",
      "Punching \n",
      "Punching may be done to create a decorative pattern, or to make a hole.\n",
      "For example, in preparation for making a hammerhead, a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle.\n",
      "Punching is not limited to depressions and holes.\n",
      "It also includes cutting, slitting, and drifting—all done with a chisel.\n",
      "Combining processes \n",
      "The five basic forging processes are often combined to produce and refine the shapes necessary for finished products.\n",
      "For example, to fashion a cross-peen hammer head, a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face: the handle hole would be punched and drifted (widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it), the head would be cut (punched, but with a wedge), the peen would be drawn to a wedge, and the face would be dressed by upsetting.\n",
      "As with making a chisel, since it is lengthened by drawing it would also tend to spread in width.\n",
      "A smith would therefore frequently turn the chisel-to-be on its side and hammer it back down—upsetting it—to check the spread and keep the metal at the correct width.\n",
      "Or, if a smith needed to put a 90-degree bend in a bar and wanted a sharp corner on the outside of the bend, they would begin by hammering an unsupported end to make the curved bend.\n",
      "Then, to \"fatten up\" the outside radius of the bend, one or both arms of the bend would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve.\n",
      "So they would hammer the ends of the stock down into the bend, 'upsetting' it at the point of the bend.\n",
      "They would then dress the bend by drawing the sides of the bend to keep the correct thickness.\n",
      "The hammering would continue—upsetting and then drawing—until the curve had been properly shaped.\n",
      "In the primary operation was the bend, but the drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape.\n",
      "Welding \n",
      "Welding is the joining of the same or similar kind of metal.\n",
      "A modern blacksmith has a range of options and tools to accomplish this.\n",
      "The basic types of welding commonly employed in a modern workshop include traditional forge welding as well as modern methods, including oxyacetylene and arc welding.\n",
      "In forge welding, the pieces to join are heated to what is generally referred to as welding heat.\n",
      "For mild steel most smiths judge this temperature by color: the metal glows an intense yellow or white.\n",
      "At this temperature the steel is near molten.\n",
      "Any foreign material in the weld, such as the oxides or \"scale\" that typically form in the fire, can weaken it and cause it to fail.\n",
      "Thus the mating surfaces to be joined must be kept clean.\n",
      "To this end a smith makes sure the fire is a reducing fire: a fire where, at the heart, there is a great deal of heat and very little oxygen.\n",
      "The smith also carefully shapes mating faces so that as they come together foreign material squeezes out as the metal is joined.\n",
      "To clean the faces, protect them from oxidation, and provide a medium to carry foreign material out of the weld, the smith sometimes uses flux—typically powdered borax, silica sand, or both.\n",
      "The smith first cleans parts to be joined with a wire brush, then puts them in the fire to heat.\n",
      "With a mix of drawing and upsetting the smith shapes the faces so that when finally brought together, the center of the weld connects first and the connection spreads outward under the hammer blows, pushing out the flux (if used) and foreign material.\n",
      "The dressed metal goes back in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed.\n",
      "Flux is sometimes applied, which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging, and it is returned to the fire.\n",
      "The smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal.\n",
      "There is some challenge to this because, to see the color of the metal, the smith must remove it from the fire—exposing it to air, which can rapidly oxidize it.\n",
      "So the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire, prodding lightly at the mating faces.\n",
      "When the end of the wire sticks on to the metal, it is at the right temperature (a small weld forms where the wire touches the mating face, so it sticks).\n",
      "The smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface.\n",
      "(Note that smiths don't always use flux, especially in the UK.)\n",
      "Now the smith moves with rapid purpose, quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together.\n",
      "A few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux—and finally, the smith returns the work to the fire.\n",
      "The weld begins with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to \"set\" the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.\n",
      "Finishing \n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the intended use of the piece, a blacksmith may finish it in a number of ways:\n",
      "\n",
      " A simple jig (a tool) that the smith might only use a few times in the shop may get the minimum of finishing—a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush.\n",
      "Files bring a piece to final shape, removing burrs and sharp edges, and smoothing the surface.\n",
      "Heat treatment and case-hardening achieve the desired hardness.\n",
      "The wire brush—as a hand tool or power tool—can further smooth, brighten, and polish surfaces.\n",
      "Grinding stones, abrasive paper, and emery wheels can further shape, smooth, and polish the surface.\n",
      "A range of treatments and finishes can inhibit oxidation and enhance or change the appearance of the piece.\n",
      "An experienced smith selects the finish based on the metal and on the intended use of the item.\n",
      "Finishes include (among others): paint, varnish, bluing, browning, oil, and wax.\n",
      "Blacksmith's striker \n",
      "\n",
      "A blacksmith's striker is an assistant (frequently an apprentice) whose job is to swing a large sledgehammer in heavy forging operations, as directed by the blacksmith.\n",
      "In practice, the blacksmith holds the hot iron at the anvil (with tongs) in one hand, and indicates where to strike the iron by tapping it with a small hammer in the other hand.\n",
      "The striker then delivers a heavy blow to the indicated spot with a sledgehammer.\n",
      "During the 20th century and into the 21st century, this role has become increasingly unnecessary and automated through the use of trip hammers or reciprocating power hammers.\n",
      "Blacksmith's materials \n",
      "When iron ore is smelted into usable metal, a certain amount of carbon is usually alloyed with the iron.\n",
      "(Charcoal is almost pure carbon.)\n",
      "The amount of carbon significantly affects the properties of the metal.\n",
      "If the carbon content is over 2%, the metal is called cast iron, because it has a relatively low melting point and is easily cast.\n",
      "It is quite brittle, however, and cannot be forged so therefore not used for blacksmithing.\n",
      "If the carbon content is between 0.25% and 2%, the resulting metal is tool steel, which can be heat treated as discussed above.\n",
      "When the carbon content is below 0.25%, the metal is either \"wrought iron (wrought iron is not smelted and cannot come from this process) \" or \"mild steel.\"\n",
      "The terms are never interchangeable.\n",
      "In preindustrial times, the material of choice for blacksmiths was wrought iron.\n",
      "This iron had a very low carbon content, and also included up to 5% of glassy iron silicate slag in the form of numerous very fine stringers.\n",
      "This slag content made the iron very tough, gave it considerable resistance to rusting, and allowed it to be more easily \"forge welded,\" a process in which the blacksmith permanently joins two pieces of iron, or a piece of iron and a piece of steel, by heating them nearly to a white heat and hammering them together.\n",
      "Forge welding is more difficult with modern mild steel, because it welds in a narrower temperature band.\n",
      "The fibrous nature of wrought iron required knowledge and skill to properly form any tool which would be subject to stress.\n",
      "Modern steel is produced using either the blast furnace or arc furnaces.\n",
      "Wrought iron was produced by a labor-intensive process called puddling, so this material is now a difficult-to-find specialty product.\n",
      "Modern blacksmiths generally substitute mild steel for making objects traditionally of wrought iron.\n",
      "Sometimes they use electrolytic-process pure iron.\n",
      "Other metals \n",
      "Many blacksmiths also incorporate materials such as bronze, copper, or brass in artistic products.\n",
      "Aluminum and titanium may also be forged by the blacksmith's process.\n",
      "Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, while brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.\n",
      "Each material responds differently under the hammer and must be separately studied by the blacksmith.\n",
      "Terminology \n",
      "\n",
      " Iron is a naturally occurring metallic element.\n",
      "It is almost never found in its native form (pure iron) in nature.\n",
      "It is usually found as an oxide or sulfide, with many other impurity elements mixed in.\n",
      "Wrought iron is the purest form of iron generally encountered or produced in quantity.\n",
      "It may contain as little as 0.04% carbon (by weight).\n",
      "From its traditional method of manufacture, wrought iron has a fibrous internal texture.\n",
      "Quality wrought-iron blacksmithing takes the direction of these fibers into account during forging, since the strength of the material is stronger in line with the grain than across the grain.\n",
      "Most of the remaining impurities from the initial smelting become concentrated in silicate slag trapped between the iron fibers.\n",
      "This slag produces a lucky side effect during forge-welding.\n",
      "When the silicate melts, it makes wrought iron self-fluxing.\n",
      "The slag becomes a liquid glass that covers the exposed surfaces of the wrought iron, preventing oxidation which would otherwise interfere with the successful welding process.\n",
      "Steel is an alloy of iron and between 0.3% and 1.7% carbon by weight.\n",
      "The presence of carbon allows steel to assume one of several different crystalline configurations.\n",
      "Macroscopically, this is seen as the ability to \"turn the hardness of a piece of steel on and off\" through various processes of heat-treatment.\n",
      "If the concentration of carbon is held constant, this is a reversible process.\n",
      "Steel with a higher carbon percentage may be brought to a higher state of maximum hardness.\n",
      "Cast iron is iron that contains between 2.0% to 6% carbon by weight.\n",
      "There is so much carbon present that the hardness cannot be switched off.\n",
      "Hence, cast iron is a brittle metal, which can break like glass.\n",
      "Cast iron cannot be forged without special heat treatment to convert it to malleable iron.\n",
      "Steel with less than 0.6% carbon content cannot be hardened enough by simple heat-treatment to make useful hardened-steel tools.\n",
      "Hence, in what follows, wrought-iron, low-carbon-steel, and other soft unhardenable iron varieties are referred to indiscriminately as just iron.\n",

      "Kurdalaegon prepares a type of tower or scaffold above a quenching bath for Xamyc, and, when the time is right, lances the cyst to liberate the infant hero Batraz as a newborn babe of white-hot steel, whom Kurdalægon then quenches like a newly forged sword.\n",

      "These metals are all quite malleable, and humans' initial development of hammering techniques was undoubtedly applied to these metals.\n",
      "During the Chalcolithic era and the Bronze Age, humans in the Mideast learned how to smelt, melt, cast, rivet, and (to a limited extent) forge copper and bronze.\n",
      "Bronze is an alloy of copper and approximately 10% to 20% Tin.\n",
      "Bronze is superior to just copper, by being harder, being more resistant to corrosion, and by having a lower melting point (thereby requiring less fuel to melt and cast).\n",
      "Much of the copper used by the Mediterranean World came from the island of Cyprus.\n",
      "Most of the tin came from the Cornwall region of the island of Great Britain, transported by sea-borne Phoenician and Greek traders.\n",
      "Copper and bronze cannot be hardened by heat-treatment, they can only be hardened by cold working.\n",
      "To accomplish this, a piece of bronze is lightly hammered for a long period of time.\n",
      "The localized stress-cycling causes work hardening by changing the size and shape of the metal's crystals.\n",
      "The hardened bronze can then be ground to sharpen it to make edged tools.\n",
      "Clocksmiths as recently as the 19th century used work hardening techniques to harden the teeth of brass gears and ratchets.\n",
      "Tapping on just the teeth produced harder teeth, with superior wear-resistance.\n",
      "By contrast, the rest of the gear was left in a softer and tougher state, more capable of resisting cracking.\n",
      "Bronze is sufficiently corrosion-resistant that artifacts of bronze may last thousands of years relatively unscathed.\n",
      "Accordingly, museums frequently preserve more examples of Bronze Age metal-work than examples of artifacts from the much younger Iron Age.\n",
      "Buried iron artifacts may completely rust away in less than 100 years.\n",
      "Examples of ancient iron work still extant are very much the exception to the norm.\n",
      "Iron Age \n",
      "Concurrent with the advent of alphabetic characters in the Iron Age, humans became aware of the metal iron.\n",
      "However, in earlier ages, iron's qualities, in contrast to those of bronze, were not generally understood.\n",
      "Iron artifacts, composed of meteoric iron, have the chemical composition containing up to 40% nickel.\n",
      "As this source of this iron is extremely rare and fortuitous, little development of smithing skills peculiar to iron can be assumed to have occurred.\n",
      "That we still possess any such artifacts of meteoric iron may be ascribed to the vagaries of climate, and the increased corrosion-resistance conferred on iron by the presence of nickel.\n",
      "During the (north) Polar Exploration of the early 20th century, Inughuit, northern Greenlandic Inuit, were found to be making iron knives from two particularly large nickel-iron meteors.\n",
      "One of these meteors was taken to Washington, D.C., where it was remitted to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution.\n",
      "The Hittites of Anatolia first discovered or developed the smelting of iron ores around 1500 BC.\n",
      "They seem to have maintained a near monopoly on the knowledge of iron production for several hundred years, but when their empire collapsed during the Eastern Mediterranean upheavals around 1200 BC, the knowledge seems to have escaped in all directions.\n",
      "In the Iliad of Homer (describing the Trojan War and Bronze Age Greek and Trojan warriors), most of the armor and weapons (swords and spears) are stated to have been of bronze.\n",
      "Iron is not unknown, however, as arrowheads are described as iron, and a \"ball of iron\" is listed as a prize awarded for winning a competition.\n",
      "The events described probably occurred around 1200 BC, but Homer is thought to have composed this epic poem around 700 BC; so exactitude must remain suspect.\n",
      "When historical records resume after the 1200 BC upheavals and the ensuing Greek Dark Age, iron work (and presumably blacksmiths) seem to have sprung like Athena, fully-grown from the head of Zeus.\n",
      "Very few artifacts remain, due to loss from corrosion, and re-use of iron as a valuable commodity.\n",
      "What information exists indicates that all of the basic operations of blacksmithing were in use as soon as the Iron Age reached a particular locality.\n",
      "The scarcity of records and artifacts, and the rapidity of the switch from Bronze Age to Iron Age, is a reason to use evidence of bronze smithing to infer about the early development of blacksmithing.\n",
      "It is uncertain when Iron weapons replaced Bronze weapons because the earliest Iron swords did not significantly improve on the qualities of existing bronze artifacts.\n",
      "Unalloyed iron is soft, does not hold an edge as well as a properly constructed bronze blade and needs more maintenance.\n",
      "Iron ores are more widely available than the necessary materials to create bronze however, which made iron weapons more economical than comparable bronze weapons.\n",
      "Small amounts of steel are often formed during several of the earliest refining practices, and when the properties of this alloy were discovered and exploited, steel edged weapons greatly outclassed bronze.\n",
      "Iron is different from most other materials (including bronze), in that it does not immediately go from a solid to a liquid at its melting point.\n",
      "H2O is a solid (ice) at −1 C (31 F), and a liquid (water) at +1 C (33 F).\n",
      "Iron, by contrast, is definitely a solid at , but over the next  it becomes increasingly plastic and more \"taffy-like\" as its temperature increases.\n",
      "This extreme temperature range of variable solidity is the fundamental material property upon which blacksmithing practice depends.\n",
      "Another major difference between bronze and iron fabrication techniques is that bronze can be melted.\n",
      "The melting point of iron is much higher than that of bronze.\n",
      "In the western (Europe & the Mideast) tradition, the technology to make fires hot enough to melt iron did not arise until the 16th century, when smelting operations grew large enough to require overly large bellows.\n",
      "These produced blast-furnace temperatures high enough to melt partially refined ores, resulting in cast iron.\n",
      "Thus cast iron frying pans and cookware did not become possible in Europe until 3000 years after the introduction of iron smelting.\n",
      "China, in a separate developmental tradition, was producing cast iron at least 1000 years before this.\n",
      "Although iron is quite abundant, good quality steel remained rare and expensive until the industrial developments of Bessemer process et al.\n",
      "in the 1850s.\n",
      "Close examination of blacksmith-made antique tools clearly shows where small pieces of steel were forge-welded into iron to provide the hardened steel cutting edges of tools (notably in axes, adzes, chisels, etc.).\n",
      "The re-use of quality steel is another reason for the lack of artifacts.\n",
      "The Romans (who ensured that their own weapons were made with good steel) noted (in the 4th century BC) that the Celts of the Po River Valley had iron, but not good steel.\n",
      "The Romans record that during battle, their Celtic opponents could only swing their swords two or three times before having to step on their swords to straighten them.\n",
      "On the Indian subcontinent, Wootz steel was, and continues to be, produced in small quantities.\n",
      "In southern Asia and western Africa, blacksmiths form endogenous castes that sometimes speak distinct languages.\n",
      "Medieval period \n",
      "\n",
      "In the medieval period, blacksmithing was considered part of the set of seven mechanical arts.\n",
      "Prior to the industrial revolution, a \"village smithy\" was a staple of every town.\n",
      "Factories and mass-production reduced the demand for blacksmith-made tools and hardware.\n",
      "Blacksmiths typically worked in small shops, often in the center of a village or town.\n",
      "Their shops were typically equipped with a forge, an anvil, and a variety of other tools.\n",
      "The work of a medieval blacksmith was physically demanding and often dangerous.\n",
      "Blacksmiths had to be able to lift and move heavy pieces of metal, and they had to be careful not to burn themselves on the hot forge.\n",
      "Despite the challenges, blacksmithing was a respected trade in medieval society.\n",
      "Blacksmiths were considered to be skilled artisans, and their work was essential to the functioning of medieval society.\n",
      "Medieval blacksmithing techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "Medieval blacksmiths used a variety of techniques to create metal objects.\n",
      "One of the most common techniques was forging.\n",
      "Forging is the process of heating metal until it is soft enough to be shaped with a hammer and anvil.\n",
      "Another common technique was welding.\n",
      "Welding is the process of joining two pieces of metal together by heating them until they melt and then hammering them together.\n",
      "Blacksmiths also used a variety of other techniques, such as casting, cutting, and filing.\n",
      "The original fuel for forge fires was charcoal.\n",
      "Coal did not begin to replace charcoal until the forests of first Britain (during the AD 17th century), and then the eastern United States of America (during the 19th century) were largely depleted.\n",
      "Coal can be an inferior fuel for blacksmithing, because much of the world's coal is contaminated with sulfur.\n",
      "Sulfur contamination of iron and steel make them \"red short\", so that at red heat they become \"crumbly\" instead of \"plastic\".\n",
      "Coal sold and purchased for blacksmithing should be largely free of sulfur.\n",
      "European blacksmiths before and through the medieval era spent a great deal of time heating and hammering iron before forging it into finished articles.\n",
      "Although they were unaware of the chemical basis, they were aware that the quality of the iron was thus improved.\n",
      "From a scientific point of view, the reducing atmosphere of the forge was both removing oxygen (rust), and soaking more carbon into the iron, thereby developing increasingly higher grades of steel as the process was continued.\n",
      "Industrial era \n",
      "During the eighteenth century, agents for the Sheffield cutlery industry scoured the British country-side, offering new carriage springs for old.\n",
      "Springs must be made of hardened steel.\n",
      "At this time, the processes for making steel produced an extremely variable product—quality was not ensured at the initial point of sale.\n",
      "Springs that had survived cracking through hard use over the rough roads of the time, had proven to be of a better quality steel.\n",
      "Much of the fame of Sheffield cutlery (knives, shears, etc.)\n",
      "was due to the extreme lengths the companies took to ensure they used high-grade steel.\n",
      "During the first half of the nineteenth century, the US government included in their treaties with many Native American tribes, that the US would employ blacksmiths and strikers at Army forts, with the expressed purpose of providing Native Americans with iron tools and repair services.\n",
      "During the early to mid-nineteenth century, both European armies<ref>An Aide-Memoire to the Military Sciences volume 1 by Royal Engineers, British Service, 1845, Col. G.G.\n",
      "Lewis, senior editor</ref> as well as both the U.S. Federal and Confederate armies employed blacksmiths to shoe horses and repair equipment such as wagons, horse tack, and artillery equipment.\n",
      "These smiths primarily worked at a traveling forge that when combined with a limber, comprised wagons specifically designed and constructed as blacksmith shops on wheels to carry the essential equipment necessary for their work.# The ordnance manual for the use of officers of the United States army, 1861, reprinted by Scholarly Publishing Office, University of Michigan Library, December 22, 2005, \n",
      "\n",
      "Lathes, patterned largely on their woodturning counterparts, had been used by some blacksmiths since the middle-ages.\n",
      "During the 1790s Henry Maudslay created the first screw-cutting lathe, a watershed event that signaled the start of blacksmiths being replaced by machinists in factories for the hardware needs of the populace.\n",
      "Samuel Colt neither invented nor perfected interchangeable parts, but his insistence (and other industrialists at this time) that his firearms be manufactured with this property, was another step towards the obsolescence of metal-working artisans and blacksmiths.\n",
      "(See also Eli Whitney).\n",
      "As demand for their products declined, many more blacksmiths augmented their incomes by taking in work shoeing horses.\n",
      "A shoer-of-horses was historically known as a farrier in English.\n",
      "With the introduction of automobiles, the number of blacksmiths continued to decrease, many former blacksmiths becoming the initial generation of automobile Mechanics.\n",
      "The nadir of blacksmithing in the United States was reached during the 1960s, when most of the former blacksmiths had left the trade, and few if any new people were entering the trade.\n",
      "By this time, most of the working blacksmiths were those performing farrier work, so the term blacksmith was effectively co-opted by the farrier trade.\n",
      "Neoclassicism era \n",
      "\n",
      "In the final part of the 18th century, forged ironwork continued to decline due to the aforementioned industrial revolution, shapes of the elements in the designs of window grilles and other decorative functional items continued to contradict natural forms, surfaces begin to be covered in paint, cast iron elements are incorporated into the forged designs.\n",
      "Main features of Neoclassicism ironwork (also referred to as Louis XVI style and Empire style ironwork) include smooth straight bars, decorative geometric elements, double or oval volutes and the usage of elements from Classical antiquity (Meander (art), wreaths etc.).\n",
      "Typical for this kind of ironwork is that the ironwork is painted white with gold (gilded) elements.\n",
      "20th and 21st centuries \n",
      "\n",
      "During the 20th century various gases (natural gas, acetylene, etc.)\n",
      "have also come to be used as fuels for blacksmithing.\n",
      "While these are fine for blacksmithing iron, special care must be taken when using them to blacksmith steel.\n",
      "Each time a piece of steel is heated, there is a tendency for the carbon content to leave the steel (decarburization).\n",
      "This can leave a piece of steel with an effective layer of unhardenable iron on its surface.\n",
      "In a traditional charcoal or coal forge, the fuel is really just carbon.\n",
      "In a properly regulated charcoal/coal fire, the air in and immediately around the fire should be a reducing atmosphere.\n",
      "In this case, and at elevated temperatures, there is a tendency for vaporized carbon to soak into steel and iron, counteracting or negating the decarburizing tendency.\n",
      "This is similar to the process by which a case of steel is developed on a piece of iron in preparation for case hardening.\n",
      "A renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in \"do-it-yourself\" and \"self-sufficiency\" that occurred during the 1970s.\n",
      "Currently there are many books, organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing, including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs, with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events.\n",
      "Some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artist-blacksmiths.\n",
      "In 1973 the Artists Blacksmiths’ Association of North America was formed with 27 members.\n",
      "By 2013 it had almost 4000 members.\n",
      "Likewise the British Artist Blacksmiths Association was created in 1978, with 30 charter members and had about 600 members in 2013 and publish for members a quarterly magazine.\n",
      "While developed nations saw a decline and re-awakening of interest in blacksmithing, in many developing nations blacksmiths continued making and repairing iron and steel tools and hardware for people in their local area.\n",

      "The Shining \n",
      "Before making The Shining, Kubrick directed the film Barry Lyndon (1975), a highly visual period film about an Irishman who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy.\n",
      "Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow.\n",
      "Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndons lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling.\n",
      "Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages.\n",
      "Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust.\n",
      "She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining\".\n",
      "Speaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality.\n",
      "There's an evil side to it.\n",
      "One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".\n",
      "Nicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month), Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King's disapproval.\n",
      "In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period.\n",
      "These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson's and Shelley Duvall's speech patterns.\n",
      "Having chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England.\n",
      "Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.\n",
      "To enable him to shoot the scenes in chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production.\n",
      "The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel.\n",
      "In February 1979, the set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production.\n",
      "Doctor Sleep \n",
      "Warner Bros. Pictures began developing a film adaptation of Doctor Sleep as early as 2014.\n",
      "In 2016, filmmaker Akiva Goldsman was attached to write and produce the film for Warner Bros. For several years, Warner Bros. could not secure a budget for Doctor Sleep, or for a different project, a prequel to The Shining called Overlook Hotel.\n",
      "In late 2017, Warner Bros. released It, a film adaptation of King's 1986 novel of the same name, and its box office success led the studio to fast track production of Doctor Sleep.\n",
      "In January 2018, Warner Bros. hired Mike Flanagan to rewrite Goldsman's script and direct the film, with Goldsman receiving executive producer credit.\n",
      "On why he was interested in directing Doctor Sleep, Flanagan explained: \"It touches on themes that are the most attractive to me, which are childhood trauma leading into adulthood, addiction, the breakdown of a family, and the after effects, decades later\".\n",
      "From June to November, the cast was assembled.\n",
      "Filming began in September in the U.S. state of Georgia; locations included Atlanta and St. Simons.\n",
      "In the area of Atlanta, specific locations included Covington, Canton, Stone Mountain, Midtown, Porterdale, and Fayetteville.\n",
      "Production concluded in December.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Shining\n",
      "The creation of this miniseries is attributed to Stephen King's dissatisfaction with director Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film of the same name.\n",
      "In order to receive Kubrick's approval to re-adapt The Shining into a program closer to the original story, King had to agree in writing to eschew his frequent public criticism of Kubrick's film, save for the sole commentary that he was disappointed with Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance as though he had been insane before his arrival at the Overlook Hotel.\n",
      "ABC's success with previous miniseries adaptations of King's work, such as It (1990), The Tommyknockers (1993), and The Stand (1994), made them more than willing to offer the author to work on the screenplay for The Shining miniseries with small Broadcast Standards and Practices enforced.\n",
      "The casting team had a very difficult time finding an actor for the role of Jack Torrance as most of the considerations who rejected the role worried about being compared to Nicholson's performance in the Kubrick version.\n",
      "Two of the many actors considered included Tim Daly and Gary Sinise.\n",
      "King got very impatient, threatening to \"wait another 18 years\" if the role for Jack Torrance wasn't booked.\n",
      "Finally, via a suggestion from Rebecca De Mornay, Steven Weber was chosen for the role, four days before filming began.\n",
      "Weber accepted the offer because he was a fan of the Mick Garris-directed miniseries for The Stand and found the script he read to be \"multi-layered\" and relatable.\n",
      "King was the one who chose De Mornay for the role of Wendy.\n",
      "The producers approached her in 1994, and she accepted the role, enjoying the script for being more \"scary\", \"disturbing\", \"entertaining\", and closer to the novel than the Kubrick version.\n",
      "Aside from the motive behind the creation of the miniseries, the 1997 rendition featured an important set piece that helped to inspire the original story: The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado.\n",
      "King used the hotel that inspired him to write the book as the miniseries' location, with some interior shots in stages also in Denver.\n",
      "Garris tried to make the hotel feel as \"enclosed\" as possible to add a vibe of claustrophobia when in a closed hotel; the crew did this by emphasizing the \"darkness\" of the hotel, painting some of Stanley's areas that had recently been painted white brown.\n",
      "The production team began shooting at the Stanley Hotel in March 1997, the date chosen as it was Denver's snowiest month.\n",
      "However, on the day filming began, they realized the hotel as well as most of Estes Park was in a \"snow shadow\", meaning it garnered the least amount of snow out of all Denver areas.\n",
      "As a result, they spent $100,000 in snowmaking machines sent from Los Angeles while lucking out on \"three or four\" shooting days with actual snow falling on Estes.\n",
      "Producer Mark Carliner attributed the lucky snowfalls to a Ute shaman doing a ritual at the highest peak of the Rocky Mountains.\n",
      "The cast and crew, such as Cynthia Garris, Mick Garris' wife who plays the woman in Room 217; and Dawn Jeffrey-Nelson, Courtland Mead's acting coach claimed paranormal experiences occurring at the hotel during shooting.\n",
      "Some of the cast enjoyed working on The Shining.\n",
      "Mead \"wasn't scared\" as he had acted previously in horror films like Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996); John Durbin enjoyed the \"madness\" he got to portray with his character of Horace Derwent; and Stanley Anderson, who accepted the part of Delbert Grady based on his disappointment with the Kubrick version, tried to play the character \"real\" but with \"a sense of distance to [his] view of the other and the world, so it comes out as irony or wryness\".\n",
      "However, it was tough for Weber to play his character; because the scenes were not shot in chronological order, it was very difficult to master the character's mental state deterioration, due to it occurring gradually as the story progresses.\n",
      "Overlook\n",
      "In September 2019, J. J. Abrams and his production company, Bad Robot Productions, signed an exclusive deal to produce projects for Warner Bros.\n",
      "Seven months later, HBO Max announced to develop a spin-off series of the novel The Shining, titled Overlook.\n",
      "The new series was to consist of 10 episodes.\n",
      "Overlook aims to focus on the untold stories of the Overlook Hotel from the novel, before the Torrances' arrival.\n",
      "Abrams will produce the series through his Bad Robot banner, alongside Ben Stephenson and Rachel Rusch Rich.\n",

      "Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance writes, \"Admittedly a minor work, The Nut is frequently dismissed in critical assessments of Fairbanks's career.\n",
      "This is unfortunate, for it contains some fascinating sequences and reveals much about the actor-producer's state of mind at the time it was made.\"\n",
      "Vance also notes, \"The picture is like a chaotic funhouse, filled with magical masquerades, illusions, and gimmicks of great momentary amusement.\"\n",
      "Plot\n",
      "Charlie (Fairbanks) loves a woman, Estrell (De La Motte), who has a theory that if rich people would take a number of poor children into their homes each day, the environment would cause the children to grow up properly and become good citizens.\n",
      "Charlie organizes a party to convince rich people to participate to this cause, but the event ends up catastrophically.\n",
      "Charlie, who spends the night at the police station, meets a crook who pretend to be a member of the very influential Vanderbrook family.\n",
      "To regain Estrell’s favor, Charlie arranges a meeting with him and other false influential personalities, who are in reality burglars and gamblers.\n",
      "Realizing that he has been deceived, but in need to fulfill a promise he made, he arranges a false meeting between Estrell and dummies posing as real people.\n",
      "But Estell is not fooled and becomes indignant.\n",
      "A real Vanderbrook working as a reporter goes to investigate a report of a man dragging a body which turns out to be Charlie moving a dummy, allowing Charlie to finally meet influential people.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Estrell is lured by a man who tries to abuse her.\n",
      "Charlie finds out and rescues her, and in the end, she is satisfied and agrees to marry him.\n",

      "An air caster  is a pneumatic lifting device used to move heavy loads on flat, non-porous surfaces.\n",
      "Its operation is similar to a hovercraft, as it uses a thin layer of air as a way to float a very small distance off the ground.\n",
      "Compressed air enters an airbag shaped like a torus, and when the bag is filled it creates an airtight seal with the ground, and forces more air into the center of torus, eventually causing the air to flow over the bag and to raise the load above the ground.\n",
      "The compressed air is forced under the airbag, pushing it and the load less than a millimeter off the ground.\n",
      "Limitations\n",
      "Air casters require a smooth, non-porous surface in order to maintain lift and operate properly.\n",
      "Cracks and other surface defects can interrupt the proper flow of air, causing the air cushion to dissipate and thus lose its ability to lift.\n",
      "This limits their application to fields like manufacturing, where such surfaces are abundant.\n",
      "Also necessary is connection to a system which provides compressed air, as well as a power supply.\n",
      "Usually, standard concrete warehouse or factory floors provide an adequate surface.\n",
      "Large cracks and expansion joints may need to be filled in.\n",
      "Overlay material can provide options for moving over rough surfaces.\n",
      "(Example: One can use an overlay material to move onto an area of broom finished concrete outside.\n",
      "The overlay material can be sheet metal or a heavy gauge plastic sheet material.)\n",
      "History \n",
      "The air caster (originally called the air bearing) was invented by Harry A Mackie in December 1961 as the “pendant air bearing load supporting device” for General Motors Corporation as an alternative to the overhead crane, which ran opposed to a rail, creating friction free movement.\n",
      "In November 1963, Mackie, on behalf of General Motors Corporation, filed a patent for an “air bearing support with automatic air flow regulation”.\n",
      "This was the first air caster designed to be used on the ground.\n",
      "In January 1964, David R. Snoeyenbos, while working for General Motors Corporation, revised the design of the air caster, and filed a patent for a “reversible air bearing support”.\n",
      "General Motors Corporation manufactured air casters, or “air bearings” for several years, then sold the rights to Snoeyenbos, who moved to Decatur, Illinois to found Airfloat.\n",
      "He launched his company from his brother's manufacturing shop in 1964, and officially incorporated as the Airfloat Corp in 1967.\n",

      "Due to the expansion of Denmark's post-war economy and increase in industrialization in the 1950-1960s, a large number of immigrants migrated to the country from the highly-Muslim populated nations of Yugoslavia, Turkey, Pakistan, and North Africa.\n",
      "This period was the first wave of large-scale Muslim immigration to Denmark.\n",
      "The first purpose-built mosques belonged to Ahmadi Muslims and was constructed in 1967.\n",
      "In 1973, the Danish government stopped free migration to the country.\n",

      "In the 1980s, a second wave of Muslims immigrated to Denmark, mainly from Iran, the Middle East, and Africa.\n",
      "Many of these immigrants were seeking political asylum.\n",
      "Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution of Denmark, but the Church of Denmark enjoys certain privileges such as state subsidies that other religious groups in the country do not.\n",

      "Khankan became Scandinavia's first female imam when she opened that mosque.\n",

      "2 in A major, Op.\n",
      "2, No.\n",
      "2, was written in 1795 and dedicated to Joseph Haydn.\n",
      "It was published simultaneously with his first and third sonatas in 1796.\n",
      "Donald Francis Tovey wrote, \"The second sonata is flawless in execution and entirely beyond the range of Haydn and Mozart in harmonic and dramatic thought, except in the Finale.\"\n",
      "A typical performance of the entire sonata lasts about 22 minutes.\n",
      "The sonata was the first Beethoven sonata to reach America and was performed in New York on June 5, 1807.\n",
      "Structure\n",
      "The sonata is laid out in four movements:\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Allegro vivace\n",
      "\n",
      "The first movement is an athletic movement that has a bright disposition.\n",
      "The second theme of exposition contains some striking modulations for the time period.\n",
      "A large portion of the development section is in F major, which contains a third relationship with the key of the work, A major.\n",
      "A difficult, but beautiful canonic section is also to be found in the development.\n",
      "The recapitulation contains no coda and the movement ends quietly and unassumingly.\n",
      "Tovey wrote, \"The opening of the second subject in the first movement is a wonderful example of the harmonic principle previously mentioned...In all music, nothing equally dramatic can be found before the D minor sonata, Op.\n",
      "31 No.\n",
      "2 which is rightly regarded as marking the beginning of Beethoven's second period.\"\n",
      "II.\n",
      "Largo appassionato\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the few instances in which Beethoven uses the tempo marking Largo, which was the slowest such marking for a movement.\n",
      "The opening imitates the style of a string quartet and features a staccato pizzicato-like bass against lyrical chords.\n",
      "A high degree of contrapuntal thinking is evident in Beethoven's conception of this movement.\n",
      "The key is the subdominant of A major, D major.\n",
      "Tovey wrote, \"The slow movement shows a thrilling solemnity that immediately proves the identity of the pupil of Haydn with the creator of the 9th symphony.\"\n",
      "III.\n",
      "Scherzo: Allegretto\n",
      "\n",
      "A short and graceful movement that is in many respects similar to a minuet.\n",
      "This is the first instance in his 32 numbered sonatas in which the term \"Scherzo\" is used.\n",
      "The A minor trio section adds contrast to the cheerful opening material of this movement.\n",
      "Unusually, there is a second melody (not in the trio) in the remote key of G minor.\n",
      "IV.\n",
      "Rondo: Grazioso\n",
      "\n",
      "A beautiful and lyrical rondo.\n",
      "The arpeggio that opens the repeated material becomes more elaborate at each entrance.\n",
      "The form of this rondo is A1–B1–A2–C–A3–B2–A4–Coda.\n",
      "The C section, in the parallel minor A minor, is rather agitated and stormy in comparison to the rest of the work, and is representative of the so-called \"Sturm und Drang\" style.\n",
      "A simple but elegant V7–I perfect cadence closes the entire work in the lower register, played piano.\n",

      "It gains both its common and scientific name from its propensity to turn black from cutting or bruising.\n",
      "Taxonomy\n",
      "It is placed in the Compactae group, subsection Nigricantinae  by Bon.\n",
      "It was first described by the French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1798 as Agaricus nigricans, before gaining its current binomial name from the father of mycology, the Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries.\n",
      "Its specific epithet is the Latin nigricans 'blackening'.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "This is a large member of the genus Russula, and it has a cap that is dirty white when young, but swiftly turns brown, and then black on aging.\n",
      "It measures  in diameter.\n",
      "There is usually a large depression in the centre of mature caps, which are three quarter peeling.\n",
      "The stem is white, firm, and straight, measuring  long and  wide; it too blackens with age.\n",
      "The gills are off-white initially, very widely spaced, and are adnate.\n",
      "These turn red; then grey, and finally black, when bruised.\n",
      "The flesh, which has a fruity smell, when cut turns pale Indian red, and then grey, and black within 20 minutes.\n",
      "The spore print is white, and the warty oval spores measure 7–8 x 6–7 μm.\n",
      "Old specimens are sometimes parasitised by fungi of the genus Asterophora or Nyctalis, in particular the species N. parasitica and N. asterophora (the pick-a-back toadstool).\n",
      "Distribution and habitat\n",
      "Russula nigricans appears in late summer and autumn in both deciduous and coniferous woodland across Britain, Northern Europe, and at least the East Coast of North America.\n",

      "Modern Malay loanwords are now primarily from English, Arabic and Javanese — English being the language of trade and technology while Arabic is the language of religion (Islam in the case of this language's concentrated regions), although key words such as surga/ syurga (heaven) and the word \"religion\" itself (agama) reflect their Sanskrit-Hindu origins.\n",
      "Javanese elements on the other hand are incorporated from the variant of Malay used in Indonesia through the consumption of media from said country.\n",
      "While based on Malay itself, Indonesian is traditionally more influenced by Javanese and Sundanese, as the Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Indonesia, with Javanese having the largest number of native speakers.\n",
      "Dutch influence over Indonesian vocabulary also is significant, as the Malay language itself was favored and adopted due to its trading benefit during VOC era over the archipelago, leading to mass loanword and influence over the modern Indonesian language.\n",
      "It is known that at least one third of the Indonesian vocabulary grew under Dutch influence.\n",
      "There are some words in Malay which are spelled exactly the same as in its other language counterparts, e.g.\n",
      "in English – museum (Indonesian), hospital (Malaysian), format, lesbian, transit etc.\n",
      "In contrast, some Malay words have been loaned into other languages, e.g.\n",
      "in English – rice paddy (\"Padi\"), orangutan, rattan, babirusa, cockatoo, compound, gong, tuak, sago, cootie, amok, durian, agar, rambutan, keris, Pantoum/pantun, \"so long\", angrecum (anggrek/ anggrik), cassowary, gingham, caddie, camphor (kapur), Gutta-percha (getah perca), launch, parang, sarong, dammar, gambir.\n",

      "Caruana originally made headlines in 2006 when he claimed that a statue of the Virgin Mary in his home was weeping blood and oozing oil.\n",
      "The blood was later identified as Angelik's own and the oil as burnt cooking oil.\n",
      "The Borġ in-Nadur site sometimes received more than 200 visitors, and Caruana has a number of followers who circulate his messages through newsletters and the internet.\n",
      "In January 2016, the Catholic Church decreed that Caruana's messages were not divine in nature, and should not be promoted.\n",
      "The curia were particularly concerned over Caruana's \"monetary gain\" from the reported apparations, and two cases where Caruana had told cancer patients that their illness has been cured, only for them to die weeks later.\n",
      "History\n",
      "\n",
      "In January and April 2006, Caruana reported that a statue of the Virgin Mary in his house in Birżebbuġa was issuing tears of blood.\n",
      "Mrs. Caruana had felt so drawn towards the statue while it was on display in a Birzebbuga pet shop, that she immediately purchased it and placed it in a prominent place in her residence.\n",
      "Three days later, on the 23rd January, tears of a red liquid oozed from the statue.\n",
      "In April that year he reported his first vision of the Virgin Mary in a local church, in which she referred to herself as the \"Immaculate Conception and the Queen of Peace and the Family\" and asked for the urgent conversion of Maltese families, and prayer for the conversion of the people of Iran, Russia, America, China and Australia.\n",
      "Apparitions began to occur more regularly, although without any pattern, and in June 2006, Caruana reported apparitions on the 19, 23 and 30.\n",
      "Father Hayden Williams was notified of the events and became Caruana's spiritual director under his own initiative, without the support of the church, accompanying him on many occasions during his apparitions.\n",
      "Starting in December 2006, Caruana was reporting weekly apparitions on a hill at Borġ in-Nadur, which he described as \"the special place Mother Mary has chosen for the apparitions\".\n",
      "These apparitions included conversations with the Virgin Mary, visions of souls in Purgatory, vision of the Archangel Uriel, Satanic attacks, mystic visions of Jesus on the Cross, the apparition of the Eucharist on Caruana's hands and his subsequent Holy Communion, and visions of other supernatural phenomena.\n",
      "During a vision on February 28, 2007, on Borg in-Nadur Hill, Angelik Caruana is reported to have said the Madonna told him she is appearing in Malta because she wants people to accept her son again.\n",
      "The public messages Caruana gives on Borġ in-Nadur Hill are now recorded live by the priests accompanying him, and are read out to an audience.\n",
      "All the messages are also posted to an official website.\n",
      "Lengthy messages start out with \"My dear children\" where Caruana greets the listeners as the Virgin Mary's children.\n",
      "Caruana's messages have directed the pilgrims present to meditate on the rosary daily as the means to acquire peace, and have said that Mass is more of a necessity than visiting the site of Borġ in-Nadur, although Caruana has said that he believed the Virgin Mary wanted the people to visit the site and pray as \"it is a special place that she herself has chosen\".\n",
      "In 2010, Caruana was directed by the Virgin Mary to travel to Gozo, Malta's sister island where he described further apparitions from her at a site in Xewkija.\n",
      "In 2011, Caruana travelled to the Vatican, where it was reported he climbed over a security barrier to interrupt a general audience with Pope Benedict XVI, in order to personally deliver a letter containing \"devotional messages\".\n",
      "Caruana was escorted from the venue by Vatican security.\n",
      "Other visions \n",
      "\n",
      "Archangel Uriel is a guardian angel who Caruana describes as being visible only to him.\n",
      "Caruana has spoken of how the angel can transport his soul to different places.\n",
      "On a particular occasion, Caruana described how his soul was transported over five hundred miles to Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n",
      "Uriel reportedly ministers the Eucharist to Caruana.\n",
      "Several witnesses have reported the Eucharist appearing out of nowhere, with Caruana receiving it in his hands and subsequent Holy Communion.\n",
      "Caruana talks of communing with souls from Purgatory, who ask for intercession so that they might be transferred to heaven.\n",
      "The visits from the souls in Purgatory include a re-visitation at the time of their entrance in heaven, when Caruana is able to witness them entering the pearly gates.\n",
      "Caruana considers it important to pray for the departed.\n",
      "St. Francis of Assisi has also appeared in Caruana's visions, and has spoken to him about the need to \"radically change the Church from the inside\".\n",
      "Caruana reports experiencing pain related to Jesus' sufferinġ Every Friday, he describes feeling the five wounds of Jesus during the Crucifixion, and occasionally the crown of thorns and the flagellation.\n",
      "Caruana believes that the Virgin Mary has told him that one day he will also demonstrate visible stigmata of these injuries.\n",
      "Caruana has described several demonic attacks on his person, and has experienced three visions of Hell.\n",
      "In the first vision, the Virgin Mary's hands emitted a blazing fire that extended between the cross and the bronze-age wall, passing through an assembled crowd of the damned, who Caruana saw to be blaspheming and fighting one another.\n",
      "Within the flames and among the people Caruana perceived many devils that had the shape of humans and animals, who began to mock the people while hovering above them.\n",
      "Fr.\n",
      "Hayden reported Caruana as asking \"Why is it Lady that you are now showing me hell?\"\n",
      "Caruana experienced a similar vision in July 2008, causing him to weep, and request a sign from the Virgin Mary.\n",
      "He reported her reply as a request that she would only issue such a sign following sufficient conversion.\n",
      "Messages from the hill \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the messages recorded by Caruana take the form of teachings, on subjects such as the existence of Satan, the rejection of Halloween as an American \"party\" tradition, and the variety of sins which will condemn a soul to Hell, including abortion, divorce, euthanasia, pornography, drug abuse, child abuse and premarital sex.\n",
      "Modern attitudes to marriage have been singled out for particular concern, with Internet pornography and workplace sexual harassment being cited by Caruana as breaking up many thousands of families, and divorce being a source of \"disorder and confusion\", with children becoming \"as though orphans\".\n",
      "Speaking on behalf of the Virgin Mary, Caruana has expressed messages of support for Malta's anti-abortion perspective, saying that only \"those who have cast aside Jesus Christ can regard abortion as a good thing\".\n",
      "He has also spoken of the dangers of drug abuse, which cause those around the abuser to suffer, and which he describes as a means of \"Satanic rule\".\n",
      "The Virgin Mary's suffering in relation to mankind's wrongdoing is frequently mentioned in Caruana's messages.\n",
      "In 2010, Caruana began to speak on apocalyptic themes, quoting the Virgin Mary in saying that \"the time of darkness and tribulation\" was near, and that Malta was fortunate to have Caruana passing on messages from Jesus via Mary.\n",
      "Religious conversion is a recurring theme in the messages recorded by Caruana, who calls for an \"urgent conversion\" from all the countries of the world, particularly Iran, Russia, America, China and Australia.\n",
      "Caruana has given messages which predict future events relating to the apparitions.\n",
      "On the 5 of August 2009, Caruana reported that the Virgin Mary had promised that miraculous water would issue from the plant at by the foot of the cross at Borġ in-Nadur Hill, \"for two whole years\".\n",
      "In June 2010, Caruana reported another message about the promised miraculous stream of water from the plant and said that the time when this will happen was \"not far off\".\n",
      "Again on 4 August 2010, a year after the first prediction, Caruana reported a message from the apparition which said \"the time is fast approaching!\n",
      "The time for which my Son Jesus has sent me is near.\n",
      "Indeed, my children, soon the flow of water up here will be created.\"\n",
      "On 4 August 4, 2011, according to Caruana, the Virgin Mary was said to have promised a spring that would provide water that will heal the sick.\n",

      "Hayden Williams O.F.M.\n",
      "(Cap) accompanied Caruana in an unofficial capacity since the start of the alleged visions in 2006, to February 2013, when his were duties were passed to Fr.\n",
      "Anton Gouder.\n",
      "The Church has made it clear that Fr Williams was not assigned by the Archbishop but took up the position under his own initiative.\n",
      "In 2009, after Caruana had claimed to possess a statuette of the Madonna which wept blood and leaked oil on his kitchen table, a forensic investigator and a pathologist were commissioned by the Archbishop to investigate the claims.\n",
      "Tests on the substance showed it to be ordinary cooking oil, with the \"blood\" being a burnt form of the oil.\n",
      "The Archbishop's Curia investigated another case where Caruana reported blood on the face of a statue of the Madonna, and although the substance was shown to be human blood, an expensive forensic investigation identified it as Caruana's own.\n",
      "In October 2012 church authorities in Malta issued a directive that phenomena and messages such as those alleged to occur at Borg in-Nadur were no longer to be announced and interpreted in the public fora.\n",
      "\"...[I]n a spirit of discernment and evaluation of these alleged phenomena and messages, the authorities of the Church in Malta feel that the time is ripe to issue this directive\".\n",
      "Furthermore, the church said that, Angelik Caruana will only attend activities at Borg in Nadur on the 26th of every month.\n",
      "In 2016, the Archbishop's Curia issued a decree, signed by Archbishop Charles Scicluna, concluding that Caruana's messages were neither divine nor supernatural.\n",
      "The decision was reached following consultation with the College of Consultors and the Bishop of Gozo Mario Grech.\n",
      "The curia were concerned over Caruana receiving monetary gain from his reported apparations, as Vatican policy is that \"genuine apparition cases should not be linked to some monetary gain\".\n",
      "Concern was also raised over a number of cases of \"false miracles\" claimed by Caruana, with two instances where he had told cancer patients that their illness has been cured, only for them to die within a month.\n",
      "The decree advised that \"Priests, male and female religious, Catechists and all the Christian faithful are to refrain from the promotion, in any way whatsoever, of the said alleged apparitions, the said alleged messages and the other alleged mystical phenomena related to this case.\"\n",

      "The mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) is a species of North American cyprinid freshwater fish in the genus Notropis.\n",
      "The genus Notropis is commonly known as the eastern shiners.\n",
      "It is native to areas of the Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, much of the Mississippi River basin including areas of Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and regions of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas.\n",
      "However, this particular species can be found in other places such as the Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut and Housatonic rivers.\n",
      "This genus is usually characterized by almost all having a complete lateral line, 8 dorsal fin rays, a premaxillae protactile, and a silvery or speckled peritoneum.\n",
      "As the common name indicates, this species is difficult to classify in the wild because it looks similar to many other shiners.\n",
      "In fact, some even hypothesize that this species is actually a complexity of many cryptic species.\n",
      "While this is the case, it is important to take more caution to not misidentify this species and to understand its impact on introduced areas.\n",
      "The diet of N. volucellus consists of some terrestrial insects, small crustaceans, and midge pupae and larvae.\n",
      "Mimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years, and are suspected to reach sexual maturity after one year.\n",
      "In lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants.\n",
      "When found in small streams N. volucellus are generally in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes.\n",
      "The diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer.\n",
      "This fish is suspected to have been introduced to many areas via bait bucket release.\n",
      "Because negative impacts of the introduction of this species have not been documented and because this species is not listed as threatened, there is not much immediate need for conservation efforts of this species.\n",
      "Distribution\n",
      "Historically, this species has been mostly found in the southern Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, and much of Mississippi River basin except in the northern Great Plains region and is oddly missing from many of its tributaries.\n",
      "The mimic shiner is also in Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, and Housatonic rivers along with the region of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas.\n",
      "However, currently this species can also be found in Susquehanna River, drainage in New York, Potomac River, East Branch of the Delaware River collected in 2002, Connecticut River drainage of Massachusetts, low altitude, Connecticut regions such as Westhill Pond, upper Nashua drainage of Massachusetts, Housatonic River drainage in Massachusetts.\n",
      "It is suspected that the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas may be due to a change in hydraulic regimes due to fragmentation of landscapes along with urbanization and development.\n",
      "Due to fragmentation of the landscape near or around riverine ecosystems, there is less available vegetation along these areas.\n",
      "With less vegetation, a faster flow of water pours into streams and rivers and possibly causes erosion to its banks.\n",
      "This influx of water and higher velocity of flow could have negative impacts on this species that lives in areas that has a relatively slow to moderate current.\n",
      "Ecology\n",
      "Notropis volucellus can generally be found in sandy pools of headwaters, creeks, clear small to large rivers, and in quiet areas of lakes while avoiding small, headwater streams, and swampy and marshy areas.\n",
      "In small streams N. volucellus are in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes.\n",
      "When monitoring one most often will find mimic shiners near riffles in current and often will find them schooling in mid-water or at the surface of water.\n",
      "Because this is a small fish, mimic shiners have many piscivorous predators that are bigger in size.\n",
      "Such predators include northern pike walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, rock bass, and brown bullhead among others.\n",
      "The diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer.\n",
      "One study showed that Daphnia was present in 85% of all stomachs sampled and zooplankton  (copepods and Chydorus) was found in greater than 30% of stomach samples in August.\n",
      "Fish aged at 0 ate mostly Chydorus, but in the summer were found to eat varying amounts of invertebrates like small leeches and some chironomids.\n",
      "At age 2, mimic shiners were found to eat other invertebrates than those stated after May while their diet consisted of 50-80% filamentous algae in September and early October but less than 50% at other times.\n",
      "In this study no other large fish populations, except for some centrarchids, were found that would compete for Daphnia as a food source.\n",
      "Due to pollution from humans, many fish have been observed to bioaccumulate mercury.\n",
      "While effects of bioaccumulation are mostly studied in the larger piscivores, they can also be observed in smaller prey such as theNotropis volucellus.\n",
      "A rise in mercury levels in water could cause the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas.\n",
      "Life history\n",
      "Mimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years.\n",
      "This species, at least documented in TN, reach sexual maturity after their first year of growth.\n",
      "Spawning of this species varies depending on different locations due to differences in seasons and temperature changes.\n",
      "In Minnesota and Wisconsin this occurs from May to August while in Alabama this event occurs from mid-April to early August.\n",
      "However, because males produce nuptial tubercles from late May to early October in Tennessee, it is suggested that Notropis volucellus have a longer breeding season than other areas which peak in the summer.\n",
      "In lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants.\n",
      "In streams, however, spawning location has not yet been documented.\n",
      "Clutch sizes increases per female with an increase in body size, ranging from 74 to 386 oocytes produced from body sizes ranging from .\n",
      "These fertilized eggs are demersal and adhesive.\n",
      "Because spawning varies depending on varying seasons and temperature changes, it is not unimaginable to predict changes in spawning due to global temperature changes in the future.\n",
      "As of yet, there has not been much research regarding Notropis volucellus.\n",
      "As stated before, human-caused development and deforestation around the areas alter current of streams and also alter turbidity.\n",
      "Also stated above, the mimic shiner breeds in areas that are clear, has little current, and contains vegetation.\n",
      "Changes in the hydraulic regime of the habitats mimic shiners live in could create unfavorable conditions to reproduce.\n",
      "Current management\n",
      "Some places do claim that this species has declined significantly in certain areas.\n",
      "The department of Natural Resources of Ohio state that the mimic shiner was once found all over Ohio, but it is now not as abundant in many places as it used to be.\n",
      "In table 2 of a paper discussing effects of landscape change on fish abundances, the mimic shiner is also listed as intolerant to disturbances and thus has been decreasing in number.\n",
      "However, many other regions believe this fish to be invasive.\n",
      "The mimic shiner is suspected to have been introduced into many regions.\n",
      "The source is believed to be the spread via the sport of fishing.\n",
      "It is reported, though not commonly sold in stores as such, mimic shiners were used in vast quantities as bait in Wisconsin lake and were even used as a primary source for food for fishes at one hatchery.\n",
      "Not much is being done to protect this specific species nor are many groups focusing on the mimic shiner.\n",
      "This is not unusual seeing how it is not listed as needing protection according to the IUCN red list of threatened species the population of Notropis volucellus is stable and its conservation status is of least concern.\n",
      "While pollution and dams are a major problem or water ecosystems, this fish has not been reported to need assistance in respects to conservation.\n",
      "Instead of needing protection, they need to be prevented from being introduced into non-native areas.\n",
      "It is likely that they could cause disruption to their non-native introduced ranges due to competition for resources.\n",

      "For instance, he promoted legislation for a pure food law, improved health conditions for state prisoners, a tuberculosis sanitarium, and a \"hospital for impoverished crippled children.\"\n",
      "Also during his tenure as Governor, the Monteverde Industrial School was established, new counties were formed, and, following eight years of work, mainland Florida was finally connected to the Florida Keys via an overseas railroad.\n",
      "He left office on January 7, 1913, going on to unsuccessfully run for U.S. Senate in 1916 and serving as a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention.\n",
      "Death\n",

      "In his letter to the council, Ehmann said Gilchrist was a \"Southern racist\" and asked the council to recognize the indigenous Calusa tribe.\n",
      "Theresa Murtha, director of the Punta Gorda History Center, said the proposal was \"outrageous\".\n",
      "She said that Gilchrist was the only Governor of Florida from Punta Gorda, and had a role in the foundation of the city.\n",
      "Former cataloger Lynn Harrell said Gilchrist hired a crew of seven to eight black railroad employees and that \"he wouldn’t have had a Black crew” if he was a racist.\n",

      "\"Null-O\" is a 1958 science fiction short story by American writer Philip K. Dick.\n",
      "It examines the concept of totally unempathic and 'logical' humans (\"Null-Os\") in a parody of the plot and concepts of The Pawns of Null-A by A. E. van Vogt.\n",
      "These beings view individual collections of matter, i.e.\n",
      "any object, as subjective structures and see the true state of reality as an 'undifferentiated world of pure energy'.\n",
      "They can also move their ears independently, giving them excellent hearing.\n",
      "After attaining positions of power they proceed with a plan to ultimately return everything in the universe to this state.\n",
      "This is to be done by the construction of successively more powerful bombs, ultimately resulting in the rather improbable 'U-bomb' that will homogenise the whole universe.\n",
      "The Null-O plan is halted, however, when the 'ordinary' people of the world, who have survived the nuclear destruction of Earth's surface in the shelters built by their employers, rise up in drilling machines to stop the construction of an 'E-Bomb' designed to destroy Earth, and succeed in destroying both the E-Bomb prototype and the Null-O's themselves.\n",
      "The idea of humans without empathy is central in Dick's later works, such as  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?.\n",

      "Nabīth (Arabic:  ) is a traditional fermented drink from the Arabian Peninsula typically made from dates steeped in water, although it can also be made with dried grapes (raisins).\n",
      "Nabidh is non-intoxicating, but if left for a certain period of time, it can turn mildly intoxicating, or heavily intoxicating depending on the level of fermentation.\n",
      "Nabidh is known to increase alcoholic content to intoxication levels, depending on the surrounding conditions.\n",
      "As alcohol is considered haram by Islamic consensus, Nabidh is only fermented for a certain amount of time before it becomes alcohol.\n",
      "According to the hadith collection by Imam Malik Ibn Anas, it is forbidden to \"prepare nabidh in a gourd or in a jug smeared with pitch.\"\n",
      "History \n",
      "Rufus of Ephesus (fl.\n",
      "100 AD) wrote a tract on the beverage nabīdh, which Qusta ibn Luqa in his times translated into Arabic by the name Risālah fī al-Nabīdh.\n",
      "In 2007, after collecting and collating copies of this manuscript from different libraries around the world, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman again reintroduced and published this rare work in Urdu and Arabic.\n",
      "Arab writer Ibn Fadlan describes an encounter on the Volga with a people he calls \"Rūsiyyah,\" who may have been either Russians or Vikings.\n",
      "He relates how the Rusiyyah would drink an alcoholic drink he refers to by the name \"nabidh\".\n",
      "It is not clear what drink it actually was, but from context it is clear that it was intoxicating.\n",

      "Sally and Marsha is a comedy-drama, written by Sybille Pearson and directed by Lynne Meadow.\n",
      "It premiered Off-Broadway in 1982.\n",
      "Productions\n",
      "Pearson was a graduate student at City College, and the play was read there by Jill Eikenberry and Pamela Reed in May 1980.\n",
      "The play was developed by the Yale Repertory Theatre and first produced in a staged reading at the O'Neill Theater Center, Waterford, Connecticut in 1980.\n",
      "The play was then produced at the Yale Winterfest in 1981, with Francis Conroy as Sally and Robin Bartlett as Marsha.\n",
      "Of the 1981 Winterfest production, the New York Times wrote that this was a play \"of promise.\"\n",
      "\"The play occasionally dips into archness and ends on a predictable note, but, as written from a woman's point of view, it has some enlivening and, for men, some disheartening comments on male-female, husband-wife relations...offers two choice, contrasting roles.\"\n",
      "Sally and Marsha premiered on February 9, 1982, at the Off-Broadway Manhattan Theatre Club Stage 73 and ran for 56 performances.\n",
      "It starred Bernadette Peters as Sally and Christine Baranski as Marsha.\n",
      "According to The New York Times, \"If the reviews are good, Paramount [Pictures] and Lester Osterman will move the play to Broadway.\"\n",
      "This production marked the return of Bernadette Peters to the New York stage after eight years, when she joined the production four days before rehearsal.\n",
      "Plot\n",
      "Sally, a housewife from South Dakota, moves into an apartment in New York City.\n",
      "She is an unsophisticated young mother with two small children, whose husband travels.\n",
      "She meets her neighbor, Marsha, whose husband is a resident in orthopedics.\n",
      "Marsha is a cynical and neurotic native New Yorker.\n",
      "Throughout the course of the time they spend together, the women discuss their respective views on life.\n",
      "Although outwardly different, they come to be supportive of each other.\n",
      "Responses\n",
      "New York Times theatre critic Frank Rich wrote: \"Every once in a while, her [Pearson] play spills beyond its rigid formula to give us honest, even touching glimpses of its heroines' lives....Sally is the perfect Peters role - an indomitable waif adrift in the big city.\"\n",
      "John Simon wrote in New York Magazine that \" 'Sally and Marsha' feels like a memory play...It is almost as if Sybille Pearson, the fledgling playwright, had been given a set of theatrical building blocks used to death and asked to put them together in a way to coax new life out of them.\n",
      "Impossible, alas; but Miss Pearson does give us a handful of funny lines, a thimbleful of touching moments, and a tiny peephole on what may become a valid theatrical career.\n",
      "Bernadette Peters, having played some such Sally all her life, invests her part with enormous conviction and warmth, and incisiveness; Christine Baranski...conjures up moments that seem newly invented.\"\n",

      "Born in Santa Margherita Ligure on 10 October 1930, Berengo Gardin lived in Switzerland, Rome, Paris and Venice before starting as an amateur photographer in 1954.\n",
      "As a photographer, he was self-taught, learning photography from two years he spent in Paris working with other photographers.\n",
      "In Berengo Gardin's first year as a photographer, 1954, his first photographs were published in Il Mondo.\n",
      "This magazine, edited by Mario Pannunzio, was one to which both amateurs and professionals liked to submit their work, although until 1959 the photographs were not attributed to particular photographers.\n",
      "It \"pursued a photographic aesthetic that privileged street scenes and odd, ironic or bizarre encounters in both town and country\", and \"more than a third of the photographs published in Il Mondo were by [Berengo Gardin].\"\n",
      "His \"rare capacity for capturing simultaneous actions and objects within the same frame positioned him as an excellent candidate for that street life Pannunzio was after.\"\n",
      "Berengo Gardin would later have photo essays published in Domus, Epoca, l'Espresso, Stern, Time, Vogue Italia; Réalités; Le Figaro; and La Repubblica.\n",
      "He turned professional in 1962 and two years later moved to Milan, where he has lived since 1975.\n",
      "From 1966 to 1983 Berengo Gardin worked with Touring Club Italiano, providing much or all of the photography for books about regions of Italy and other European countries or their cities: he once identified the high point of his career as \"The work I did in Great Britain, for the Touring Club in 1978\" (adding that \"I loved the cars: I had an Austin and an MG\").\n",
      "He did similar work for the publisher Istituto Geografico De Agostini (later De Agostini Publishing).\n",
      "In 1979 Berengo Gardin started to work with Renzo Piano, photographing the process of designing his buildings.\n",
      "Berengo Gardin also worked with major Italian firms – Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Italsider (later Ilva), Olivetti and others – showing the working life of employees, rather than the products.\n",
      "In the early 1990s, Berengo Gardin spent time living among the Romani people (Zingari) of Italy, hoping to show their lives from the inside.\n",
      "This resulted in two highly regarded books, La disperata allegria (Florence) and Zingari a Palermo (1994 and 1997).\n",
      "Since 1990 Berengo Gardin has been represented by Contrasto.\n",
      "Berengo Gardin remains active in his eighties.\n",
      "A recent assignment, from la Repubblica, was to photograph the giant cruise ships that threaten the ecosystem of Venice.\n",
      "Berengo Gardin has a large archive, with over 1.5 million negatives.\n",
      "The FORMA Foundation (Fondazione FORMA per la Fotografia, an offshoot of Contrasto), in Milan, will be managing this archive, including negatives, prints, documents and cameras.\n",
      "(Other material is at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.)\n",
      "Berengo Gardin has named as influences on him the French photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson, Willy Ronis, Édouard Boubat and Robert Doisneau; others have identified the Italian group La Gondola and the American photographer W. Eugene Smith.\n",
      "Gianni Berengo Gardin is one of the great generation of poetic documentarists who like to compose with an idea in mind [...] [H]is sympathies have always been with those whose day-to-day activities support the fabric of society: workers, doctors, priests and even itinerant musicians.\n",
      "Vaporetto, Venice, 1960\n",
      "\n",
      "Berengo Gardin's \"most renowned image of Venice\", often referred to as Vaporetto, Venice, 1960:\n",
      "\n",
      "was taken in 1960, on a vaporetto with mirrored doors so that the passengers are trapped in a mosaic of reflections.\n",
      "Simultaneously mundane – the travellers are ordinary commuters – and exotic, it captures the paradox of a city trapped in an excess of representation.\n",
      "Berengo Gardin describes how it came about:\n",
      "\n",
      "I was 30, living on the Lido in Venice, and every morning I took the vaporetto, or water bus, across to where I worked in San Marco.\n",
      "[...] It was a matter of pure luck, really.\n",
      "I was doing a lot of architectural photography, and this was a spontaneous shot: I only took one picture.\n",
      "In the centre there is a reflection in the glass door of the vaporetto, behind which stands a man all dressed in black.\n",
      "If he'd been wearing white, the shot wouldn't have worked.\n",
      "The photograph was included in Berengo Gardin's book Venise des saisons (1965).\n",
      "It was warmly received; Henri Cartier-Bresson:\n",
      "\n",
      "ranked [this photograph] among the 80 most important photographs ever taken.\n",
      "The co-presence of gazes and of frames within a frame makes it an exceptional in-camera montage of different spaces and human figures, reminiscent of Velasquez's illusions, and suggestive of this photographer's multiple artistic influences: the French school of reportage (Doisneau, Boubat, Ronis) and a group of Venetian photographers called La Gondola [...] and Eugene Smith's powerful renditions of black and white.\n",
      "At the end of the 1950s this new kind of reportage seemed to reconcile  social documentary with the photographer's subjective exploration of the world, thus putting an end to the dispute about form and content that had divided many postwar image makers.\n",
      "Books\n",
      "\n",
      "Berengo Gardin has been the sole contributor or a major contributor to a large number of photobooks: the exact number up to any time depends on various definitions – what a separate book is (as opposed to a mere new edition), what a \"major\" contribution is, and more – but one estimate in 2014 put the number at 250 (and added that \"only 10 are in colour\").\n",
      "Morire di classe (1969) is probably the most celebrated among Berengo Gardin's books.\n",
      "Other award-winning books (see \"Awards\") include India dei villaggi (1981, about the villages of India) and La disperata allegria and Zingari a Palermo (1994 and 1997, about the Romani people of Florence and Palermo respectively).\n",
      "\"Books such as Dentro le case and Dentro il lavoro are some of the best journalistic records of how people worked and lived in post-WWII Italy.\"\n",
      "Exhibitions\n",
      "Berengo Gardin has had many exhibitions: the number was described in 2008 as \"around 200\".\n",

      "Function \n",
      "\n",
      "Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can mediate lysis of certain tumor cells and virus-infected cells without previous activation.\n",
      "They can also regulate specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity.\n",
      "The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) family, which is a group of transmembrane proteins preferentially expressed in NK cells.\n",
      "Studies in mice suggested that the expression of this gene may be regulated by MHC class I molecules.\n",
      "KLRG1 is a lymphocyte co-inhibitory, or immune checkpoint, receptor expressed predominantly on late-differentiated effector and effector memory CD8+ T and NK cells.\n",
      "Its ligands are E-cadherin and N-cadherin with similar affinities, respective markers of epithelial and mesenchymal cells.\n",
      "Targeting of other co-inhibitory receptors for applications in oncology has gained widespread interest (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, and its ligand PD-L1).\n",
      "Unlike the obvious enhanced immune activation present in CTLA-4 and PD-1 gene knockout mice,  KLRG1 knockout mice initially were found to have no abnormal features, though were subsequently found to have enhanced immunity in a tuberculosis challenge model.\n",
      "The characterization of KLRG1 as a “senescent” marker, but other co-inhibitory receptors as “exhaustion” markers, has contributed to relatively fewer studies on this molecule.\n",

      "Many of the 167 species are largely or entirely black, but some have bright metallic coloration.\n",
      "They produce a foul-smelling spray from glands near the tip of the abdomen.\n",
      "They are recognizable due to their large thorax, which is almost the size of their abdomen and much wider than their head.\n",

      "Teacher tenure is a policy that restricts the ability to fire teachers, requiring a \"just cause\" rationale for firing.\n",
      "The individual states each have established their own tenure systems.\n",
      "Tenure provides teachers with protections by making it difficult to fire teachers who earn tenure.\n",
      "Some states are focusing on revisions so that the tenure system no longer functions the same way as currently.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "While each state has its own specifics for how teacher tenure works, most hold a similar form.\n",
      "Each new teacher is given a probationary period (probation periods vary among states).\n",
      "During this probation period, teachers must prove they are worthy of receiving tenure.\n",
      "They must prove that they are having a positive effect on their students using a teacher evaluation system, which includes information from several facets of a teacher's responsibilities.\n",
      "Some common facets are classroom observations, student growth, and self-reflection (see, for example, New Haven  and the state of Virginia ).\n",
      "For example, currently under New Jersey's tenure system, a teacher is placed on probation for three years during which time the teacher is evaluated using a system called AchieveNJ.\n",
      "During or after these three years, the principal must decide if the school will grant tenure to this teacher.\n",
      "If so, the teacher will be asked to work there for a fourth year and will be granted tenure.\n",
      "The principal is able to fire a teacher at any time during the probation period.\n",
      "However, once a teacher is tenured, the principal can no longer fire a teacher without just cause.\n",
      "The teacher is then protected by tenure.\n",
      "There are four reasons a teacher may be fired in New Jersey once they are tenured.\n",
      "The reasons include: incapacity, inefficiency, unbecoming conduct and just cause.\n",
      "A teacher being fired for any of these reasons is given a chance to defend their case.\n",
      "History\n",
      "Tenure was created to provide teachers with due process protections.\n",
      "Some say the fight for these protections started around the 1920s as an outgrowth of the women's rights movement at a time when most teachers were women and most principals were men.\n",
      "But a historical survey of indefinite teacher tenure activities and legislation in the United States found that indefinite tenure is a direct outgrowth of the civil service reform movement of the nineteenth century and that the line of historical development extends continuously from 1880.\n",
      "The debate\n",
      "\n",
      "Proposals to change or eliminate tenure\n",
      "Several states are looking into changing (in the name of reforming) and even eliminating their teacher tenure system.\n",
      "Some of the states leading the movement include Florida, New Jersey, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Many would also like to see teachers being evaluated based on their performance and their students' academic achievement.\n",
      "In eight states in America, tenure is given to teachers after just two years of teaching during the probation period.\n",
      "In two states, tenure is awarded after only one year of teaching during the probation period.\n",
      "Washington DC does not require a  set time for awarding tenure.\n",
      "Supporters of this notion feel that one or two years is too short a time to tell if a teacher is having a positive effect on their students.\n",
      "Before these teachers are granted lifetime job protection, they would like to see them perform on probation for a longer period of time.\n",
      "Changes have been created in all forms.\n",
      "Some proposals call for longer probation periods while others call for stricter teacher evaluations.\n",
      "Other proposals wish to end the tenure system completely and replace this system with renewable contracts.\n",
      "Key actors\n",
      "Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed to (as he called it) reform the tenure system in New Jersey.\n",
      "He wished to eliminate the current tenure system and replace it with a new one.\n",
      "Currently in New Jersey, after a teacher proves themselves efficient for 3 years, they gain lifetime protection under tenure.\n",
      "Christie's proposal would also see teachers prove themselves for three years to gain tenure.\n",
      "However, after one year of being deemed \"ineffective\", teachers could easily be fired under his scheme.\n",
      "Christie wanted to judge whether a teacher is ineffective or not on a two part assessment.\n",
      "One part of the score will be based on student achievement.\n",
      "The second part of the score will be based on teacher performance.\n",
      "Christie believes the answer to making schools more effective is to place more accountability on teachers.\n",
      "Christie stated, \"Let New Jersey lead the way again,\", \"The time to eliminate teacher tenure is now.\"\n",
      "Former chancellor of DC public schools, Michelle Rhee, had made plans to eliminate teacher tenure altogether.\n",
      "Rhee designed a pay plan which would compensate teachers by giving them big pay raises in exchange for their tenure protection rights.\n",
      "She gave existing tenured teachers the choice to accept this proposal.\n",
      "New hires would be forced to accept this new pay plan.\n",
      "New hires would be paid on the basis of their students' achievement.\n",
      "While teachers would prospectively be able to make more money under this pay plan, they would not be granted any tenure protections.\n",
      "Rhee's plan was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Teachers did not want to give up their tenure protections for a higher salary.\n",
      "After this plan failed she continued to devise plans.\n",
      "She offered a buyout plan for existing teachers with tenure.\n",
      "In 2009, she created a plan called IMPACT.\n",
      "This plan tied students performance on state tests to teachers evaluation.\n",
      "While this plan gained the support of many, there were still many others who opposed it.\n",
      "Against changes in the tenure system\n",
      "In some states, schools are required to pay more to teachers who have earned higher degrees, and tenure allows teachers to secure a job, go back to school, and return to their jobs, not fearing dismissal because of their higher pay grade.\n",
      "Supporters liken tenure to the concept of seniority in other jobs.\n",
      "Teachers are often forced into uncomfortable situations (such as failing students, choosing certain students).\n",
      "An employee who makes decisions of a difficult and confrontational nature would thus require job protection.\n",
      "Many who are against the motion of reforming/eliminating tenure argue that tenure allows teaching to become a profession rather than just a job.\n",
      "Presumably, teachers would not have as much job stability and would be forced to transfer from school to school.\n",
      "Giving teachers permanent positions would allow them to form bonds and relationships with students, parents, and other faculty.\n",
      "Recent activity\n",
      "Several jurisdictions have considered changes in their tenure system since the 1990s.\n",
      "Some of these states include:\n",
      "California  has seen many attempts to change their tenure system.\n",
      "One of the more recent attempts was made by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in January 2005.\n",
      "He tried to pass an act (Excellence in Teaching Act) which would pay teachers on the basis of their performance.\n",
      "He also wanted to enact the \"Put the Kids First Act\" which would extend the probation period of teachers to five years (it is currently two years).\n",
      "This act would also allow a school to fire teachers after two unsatisfactory ratings.\n",
      "The school would no longer have to give the teacher 90 days to improve their performance before being fired.\n",
      "This stirred up much controversy among the teachers in California.\n",
      "The act was voted on and was never passed.\n",
      "Florida- In 1997 a major movement toward changing tenure took place, which its proponents considered a success.\n",
      "This change reduced the probationary period a teacher worked to achieve tenure to 97 days instead of a year.\n",
      "During those 97 days, a teacher could be fired without just cause.\n",
      "Only 101 of Florida's 10,689 new teachers were dismissed by the school in 1998.\n",
      "While this reform was considered a success by some, teacher unions stepped in and won back many protections.\n",
      "In 2009, a new plan was proposed.\n",
      "Legislators wished to get rid of tenure for all new teachers.\n",
      "Tenure would be replaced with yearly renewable contracts.\n",
      "After ten years, a teacher would be eligible for renewable contracts which would last up to five years.\n",
      "This plan was never passed by the Senate.\n",
      "New York-  In 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg voiced his concern that although teachers could be let go easily during the three year probation period, they hardly ever were.\n",
      "In 2008, Bloomberg introduced the Principal Portal.\n",
      "This was a tool that principals would use to help evaluate their teachers.\n",
      "It gave them guidelines to follow and base their decisions on.\n",
      "The number of teachers let go during their probation period doubled in the first year under the Principal Portal.\n",
      "Bloomberg also wished to have students test scores incorporated in the tenure process.\n",

      "The classified \"2022006470\" document was somehow illegally leaked from the presidential palace to the media with his identity exposed on 18 March, then Minister of National Defense, Chiu Kuo-cheng reacted: \"I will not let him get away with it\", \"Fix the crying baby!\n",

      "During her first inauguration speech, Tsai acknowledged that the talks surrounding the 1992 Consensus took place without agreeing that a consensus was reached.\n",
      "She credited the talks with spurring 20 years of dialogue and exchange between the two sides.\n",
      "She hoped that exchanges would continue on the basis of these historical facts, as well as the existence of the Republic of China constitutional system and democratic will of the Taiwanese people.\n",
      "In response, Beijing called Tsai's answer an \"incomplete test paper\" because Tsai did not agree to the content of the 1992 Consensus.\n",
      "On 25 June 2016, Beijing suspended official cross-strait communications, with any remaining cross-strait exchanges thereafter taking place through unofficial channels.\n",
      "In January 2019, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party wrote an open letter to Taiwan proposing a one country, two systems formula for eventual unification.\n",
      "Tsai responded to Xi in a January 2019 speech by stating that Taiwan rejects \"one country, two systems\" and that because Beijing equates the 1992 Consensus with \"one country, two systems\", Taiwan rejects the 1992 Consensus as well.\n",

      "In particular, the generation and distribution divisions of Taipower are to be separated.\n",
      "Amongst the stated motivations for liberalisation was to allow for the direct purchase of green energy by consumers.\n",

      "On 1 January 2017, the amended Labour Standards Law (commonly referred to as 一例一休), which was passed on 6 December 2016 by the legislature, took effect.\n",
      "The amendments stipulated, with some exceptions, a 40-hour five-day work week with one compulsory rest day and one flexible rest day.\n",
      "On the flexible rest day, workers may work for overtime pay, and the compulsory rest day guaranteed that workers could not work more than six days in a row.\n",
      "The amendments also reduced the number of national holidays from 19 to 12, eliminating Youth Day, Teachers’ Day, Retrocession Day, Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, Sun Yat-sen's birthday, Constitution Day and the day following New Year's Day.\n",
      "Prior to the amendments, the Labor Standards Act stipulated a maximum of 84 hours of work in any given 14 day period.\n",
      "The amendments were met with protests from labor groups, who opposed the reduction of national holidays and demanded that work on flexible rest days should result in compensatory vacation days in addition to overtime pay.\n",
      "After taking effect, the amendments were criticized for their lack of flexibility, resulting in a net decrease in total pay and an increase in cost of living, and for having an overly complicated scheme for calculating overtime pay, leading the administration to further revise the Labor Standards Act.\n",
      "On 1 March 2018, the second revision of the Labor Standards Act came into effect.\n",
      "The revisions relaxed the previous regulations by stipulating two compulsory rest days for each 14 day period rather than one compulsory rest day for each 7 day period, meaning that workers could work for 12 days in a row.\n",

      "Previously, the only national language was Mandarin; during her administration, the national languages of Taiwan were eventually broadened to include Mandarin, Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, 16 indigenous Formosan languages, Taiwanese Sign Language and the Matsu dialect of Eastern Min spoken on the Matsu Islands.\n",
      "The Indigenous Languages Development Act took effect on 14 June 2017, designating 16 indigenous Formosan languages as national languages.\n",

      "On 25 December 2018, the sweeping National Languages Development Act passed the legislature, creating broadcast services for each national language of Taiwan, guaranteeing access to public services in each language, and introducing elective language classes in primary schools.\n",
      "The act also directed the government to work with civic groups to create standard orthographies for each national language, and to develop a plan for preserving and revitalizing threatened languages.\n",
      "It furthermore automatically designated, in Article 3, all languages of all ethnic groups in Taiwan as national languages, thus clearing the way for Taiwanese Hokkien, Taiwanese Sign Language, and the Matsu dialect to become national languages.\n",
      "On 15 August 2019, the government amended the Enforcement Rules of the Passport Act to allow for the use of romanizations of names in any national language (Hakka, Hoklo or indigenous languages) in passports.\n",
      "On 27 September 2021, after having followed the regulation to applied in advance the real-time interpretation service and 3 Taiwanese interpreter had been present ready at site, Legislator Chen Po-wei of the Taiwan Statebuilding Party,  proceeded his scheduled questioning session in Taiwanese during the Foreign and National Defense Committee.\n",
      "The Minister of National Defense Chiu Kuo-cheng did not accept the interpreter's assistance at site, but insisted to bring the deputy minister Zong-hsiao Li as his own interpreter.\n",
      "Chiu repeatedly interrupted the question process by asking Chen to speak Mandarin Chinese for easier communication, or the session time cannot be lengthened to accommodate the interpretation, but Li is not a linguistic professional, hence his translation contains contextual errors, so Chairman Legislator Chen I-hsin intervened during the heated argument and tried to introduce the existing real-time synchronized interpretation on progress at site as the solution same as the common conference practice in the other countries, but Chiu still insisted his way  Chen later apologized to the public for the good intention of practicing the national language law being turned into a linguistic communication tragedy, and condemned Chiu for \"bullying\" (), but Chiu denied the allegation and claimed that a language is a tool of communication.\n",
      "The parliamentary interpretation service were temporarily suspended afterwards pending on better communication in the future - consequently the other parliament members and media editorials such as Kuan Bi-ling and Taipei Times commented that Language is not just a tool of communication (as Chiu said), but also an identity of feelings and culture.\n",
      "Councilor Miao Poya also explained that the multi-lingual working environment is essential for a healthy mind without the \"Chinese Language Supremacy\" () attitude to achieve the international level in diversity, equality and mutual respect for a modern state.\n",
      "New Southbound Policy \n",
      "\n",
      "The New Southbound Policy was launched on 5 September 2016 with the intent to make Taiwan less dependent on Mainland China and to improve Taiwan's cooperation with other countries.\n",
      "The 18 countries the New Southbound Policy targeted for increased cooperation are: Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Australia and New Zealand.\n",
      "The policy designated areas of cooperation in trade, technology, agriculture, medicine, education, and tourism.\n",
      "In mid-2019, the Taiwanese government announced that since the implementation of the policy, bilateral trade between Taiwan and the targeted countries increased by 22%, while investment by targeted countries increased by 60%.\n",
      "Further, the number of medical patients from targeted countries increased by 50%, the number of visitors increased by 58%, and the number of students increased by 52%.\n",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan donated 1 million masks to countries targeted in the New Southbound Policy.\n",
      "Pension reform \n",
      "\n",
      "International observers have noted that Taiwan's pre-reform pension system was due to default by 2030 for civil servants and 2020 for the military.\n",
      "Pension reform was passed via two separate bills, one dealing with civil servants and schoolteachers on 27 June 2017 and another dealing with military veterans on 20 June 2018.\n",
      "On 1 July 2018, the pension reforms came into effect.\n",
      "Civil servants, upon retirement, have a choice between receiving pensions in monthly instalments subject to a preferential interest rate or via a lump sum.\n",
      "Under the reforms, the previous preferential interest rate for those who opted for monthly instalments would be gradually reduced from 18% to 0% over the span of 30 months.\n",
      "Civil servants who opted for a lump sum would see their interest rates decreased from 18% to 6% over a period of 6 years.\n",
      "The reforms were estimated to affect 63,000 military veterans, 130,000 public servants and 140,000 schoolteachers.\n",
      "The reforms simultaneously set minimum monthly pensions for schoolteachers and civil servants at $32,160 NTD and for military veterans at $38,990 NTD.\n",
      "The reforms also raised the minimum retirement age to 60 from 55, to increase by 1 per year until the retirement age reaches 65.\n",
      "Though the reforms were met with protests from government retirees and veterans, polls have shown that the majority of Taiwanese are satisfied with the outcome of the pension reforms.\n",
      "After a legal challenge by the KMT, the Constitutional Court found most of the pension reform constitutional, while striking down clauses regarding the suspension of pensions for retirees that took jobs later in the private sector.\n",
      "Same-sex marriage and LGBT rights \n",
      "\n",
      "On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that the constitutional right to equality and freedom of marriage guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry under the Constitution of the Republic of China.\n",
      "The ruling (Judicial Yuan Interpretation No.\n",
      "748) gave the Legislative Yuan two years to bring the marriage laws into compliance, after which registration of such marriages would come into force automatically.\n",
      "Following the ruling, progress on implementing a same-sex marriage law was slow due to government inaction and strong opposition from some conservative people and Christian groups.\n",
      "In November 2018, the Taiwanese electorate passed referendums to prevent recognition of same-sex marriages in the Civil Code and to restrict teaching about LGBT issues.\n",
      "The Government responded by confirming that the Court's ruling would be implemented and that the referendums could not support laws contrary to the Constitution.\n",
      "On 20 February 2019, a draft bill entitled the Act for Implementation of J.Y.\n",
      "Interpretation No.\n",
      "748 was released.\n",
      "The draft bill would grant same-sex married couples almost all the rights available to heterosexual married couples under the Civil Code, with the exception that it only allows adoption of a child genetically related to one of them.\n",
      "The Executive Yuan passed it the following day, sending it to the Legislative Yuan for fast-tracked review.\n",
      "The bill was passed on 17 May, signed by the President on 22 May and took effect on 24 May 2019 (the last day possible under the Court's ruling).\n",
      "Transitional justice and ill-gotten assets \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "The Act on Promoting Transitional Justice () was passed by the Legislative Yuan on 5 December 2017.\n",
      "The act sought to rectify injustices committed by the authoritarian Kuomintang government of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and to this end established the Transitional Justice Commission to investigate actions taken from 15 August 1945, the date of the Hirohito surrender broadcast, to 6 November 1992, when president Lee Teng-hui lifted the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion for Fujian Province, Republic of China, ending the period of mobilization.\n",
      "This time period, in particular, includes the February 28 Incident as well as White Terror.\n",
      "The committee's main aims include: making political archives more readily available, removing authoritarian symbols, redressing judicial injustice, and producing a report on the history of the period which delineates steps to further promote transitional justice.\n",
      "Thus far, the commission has exonerated political criminals from the martial law era, made recommendations on the removal of authoritarian symbols, and declassified government documents from the martial law era.\n",
      "The Act Governing the Handling of Ill-gotten Properties by Political Parties and Their Affiliate Organizations was passed in July and Wellington Koo, one of the main authors of the Act, was named as the committee chairman in August.\n",
      "With the establishment of the committee, the KMT has insisted that it has been illegally and unconstitutionally persecuted and that the investigation is a political witch hunt.\n",
      "However, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) maintained that the means are necessary for achieving transitional justice and leveling the playing field for all political parties.\n",
      "Thus far, the committee has determined that the China Youth Corps, Central Motion Picture Corp., National Women's League, and the Broadcasting Corporation of China were KMT-affiliated organizations and either froze their assets or ordered them to forfeit them.\n",

      "SHAG won awards for design and content.\n",
      "Bryan’s novel, Bitsty Nickel Might Have AIDS, generated controversy in the early 1990s.\n",
      "The novel was optioned for film.\n",
      "Bryan abruptly departed the Southern literary scene in 1997.\n",
      "He is known to have produced a quantity of work since then but has published nothing in recent years.\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "\n",
      "Born George Waller Bryan, Junior, the author writes under his family nickname “Bo”.\n",
      "He was raised in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a seaside resort and carnival town.\n",
      "Bryan’s writing often explores the vacation mentality, the desire for escape from ordinary life, the temporary disregard of ordinary morality and its consequences.\n",
      "Bryan’s  ultra-conservative family was instrumental in founding and developing Myrtle Beach, which Bryan finds ironic, given the libertine nature of many amusements found there.\n",
      "His locally legendary grandfather was a carnival boss and village tycoon.\n",
      "His father, a lawyer and no less a local legend, prosecuted war criminals in Germany after WWII.\n",
      "George Waller Bryan, Senior (nicknamed “Buster”) went on to develop real estate, a hotel, and several golf courses, including the famed The Dunes Club.\n",
      "Buster Bryan was considered visionary for packaging golf course greens fees and hotel accommodations, attracting tens of thousands of new customers to Myrtle Beach.\n",

      "A below average student, he struggled with dyslexia.\n",
      "Sent to remedial reading camps, he made slight progress.\n",
      "His father’s disappointment carried over; expectations remained unchanged.\n",
      "Bryan rebelled, then escaped.\n",
      "In high school, he developed a gambling habit, playing poker obsessively.\n",
      "After graduation, he dropped out of college and traveled as a professional gambler.\n",
      "Upon the sudden death of his father from bronchial pneumonia, Bryan quit gambling and joined the Army.\n",
      "Bryan found that he loved to march, was a crack shot with an M-16, joined the drill team, and graduated first in his class at Leader School.\n",
      "He did not go to Vietnam.\n",
      "Released from service, he traveled, learning to crew on oceangoing sailboats.\n",
      "Telling verbal stories of his adventures, he began construction of his own legend.\n",
      "Writing career \n",
      "\n",
      "Bryan began writing at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 1971.\n",
      "Creative writing teachers Max Steele, Doris Betts, and William Blackburn allowed Bryan to audit classes.\n",
      "Having no foundation in the reader’s experience of literature, he judged himself illiterate.\n",
      "His teachers considered his condition advantageous to discovery of a unique literary voice.\n",
      "Dyslexia, long a handicap, was suddenly a catalyst for passion.\n",
      "Bryan became a constant reader.\n",
      "To writing he gave years learning sentence structure trial and error, gaining a feel for the architecture of paragraphs, finally realizing stories of his own.\n",
      "His novel, Bitsy Nickle Might Have AIDS, published in 1991, captures a moment of collision between leftover Southern Victorian morality and the post-modern sexual revolution.\n",
      "The book predates and strangely foretells of the Monica Lewinsky affair.\n",
      "Bitsy Nickle is rife with political satire and black comedy relevant to heterosexual transmission of HIV in the early years of the AIDS epidemic.\n",
      "The book was instantly controversial.\n",
      "Bryan was invited to speak at college campuses and private school auditoriums in the Bible Belt.\n",
      "While admonishing young people to protect themselves sexually, he challenged local politicians to set a good example by being publicly tested for AIDS; often elected officials invited him to leave town.\n",
      "Bitsy Nickle Might Have AIDS was optioned for film.\n",
      "Bryan’s second book SHAG, The Legendary Dance of the South', released in 1995, is accurate history recounted as prose poetry, the true story of the first social dance conceived in performance with rock n roll music.\n",
      "Before the twist, before the watusi, the frug, and the swim, in 1943, ten years before Elvis Presley, came the shag dance, a unique, fast-footed, smooth, cool derivation of the jitterbug.\n",
      "The shag became a Southern tradition, today recognized as the official state dance of both North and South Carolina.\n",

      "Jörg Asmussen (born 31 October 1966) is a German economist and banker has been serving as Chief Executive Officer of the German Insurance Association (GDV) since 2020.\n",
      "Asmussen served as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) from 2012 to 2014.\n",
      "He also served in the German federal government, most prominently as State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs from 2014 to 2016  and the Federal Ministry of Finance from 2008 to 2011.\n",
      "Asmussen has been a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP) since 1987.\n",
      "After leaving the government, Asmussen joined the investment bank Lazard in 2016 as managing director in financial advisory and rose to head of M & A for Europe and head of the Financial Institutions Group for Continental Europe.\n",
      "Early life and education\n",
      "Asmussen earned a master's degree in business administration, Bocconi University in 1992 and a Diplom degree in economics, University of Bonn in 1994.\n",
      "In Bonn, he studied under Manfred J. M. Neumann and Axel A. Weber alongside Jens Weidmann, among others.\n",
      "Career in the public sector\n",
      "After two years (1994–96) at the  in Cologne, Asmussen held a succession of positions in the German Federal Ministry of Finance.\n",
      "As a financial advisor of the coalition government 2005–2009 and as the Finance Ministry's representative for  True Sale International, an association of banks and financial service interest groups in Germany, Asmussen supported bank deregulation and an extension of the market of asset-backed securities (ABSs).\n",
      "Some sources highlighted his role in the run up to financial crisis of 2007.\n",
      "Whilst at the Ministry, Asmussen was responsible for  the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) at the time when the Düsseldorf based IKB Deutsche Industriebank had to be restructured – mainly due to ABS investments.\n",
      "Asmussen was member of the supervisory board of that bank at that time (2007).\n",
      "State Secretary at the German Federal Ministry of Finance, 2008–11\n",
      "From 2008 to 2011, Asmussen was State Secretary at the Ministry led by Wolfgang Schäuble, responsible for the Directorate's fiscal policy and macroeconomic affairs, financial market policy and European policy.\n",
      "He led the country's crisis management team following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\n",
      "He later became a central figure in negotiations with other euro zone countries on how to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.\n",
      "During his time in office, Asmussen also served as chairman of the Administrative Council of Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin); chairman of the inter-ministerial steering committee of the Financial Market Stabilisation Authority (FMSA); member of the Financial Stability Board (FSF); and board member of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).\n",
      "In addition, he served on the supervisory boards of Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).\n",
      "In May 2011, Asmussen – acting on behalf the German government – endorsed deploying the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through loans to business in the Middle East, under the condition that countries make “a firm commitment to the core principles of democracy, political pluralism and the market economy.” At the time, the EBRD was led by fellow German Social Democrat Thomas Mirow and pushing to extend its mandate to North Africa as part of a larger effort by Europe and the United States to help countries in the region during the Arab Spring.\n",
      "On 7 June 2011 Asmussen attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.\n",
      "In November 2011, Asmussen served as Chancellor Merkel's acting Sherpa to the G20 summit.\n",
      "Executive Board of the European Central Bank, 2012–14\n",
      "In January 2012,  Asmussen was appointed to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank under the leadership of President Mario Draghi, succeeding Jürgen Stark who had resigned because of his dismay over central bank bond-buying.\n",
      "The selection of Asmussen was announced at the meeting of Group of 7 countries in Marseille, France.\n",
      "At the time, his nomination was controversial in the German parliament, where members of the parties in chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right coalition – Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party – expressed skepticism because he was known to be a member of the then-opposition Social Democratic party.\n",
      "Originally rumoured to be appointed to serve as chief economist of the ECB,—a position for which French ECB board member Benoît Cœuré was also a candidate—Asmussen was instead given responsibility for International and European Relations on the board, which Draghi has expanded to include attending, alongside himself, meetings of Eurozone government leaders and finance ministers.\n",
      "Belgian Peter Praet was given responsibility for the Economics department.\n",
      "Some saw the debate around this appointment as highly controversial, when questions were asked about the North-South balance in the ECB's governing structure.\n",
      "Throughout his tenure, Asmussen often helped communicate policy to – as New York Times described it – a German public fearful that the ECB was a conduit for transferring their wealth to stricken countries like Greece.\n",
      "In German media, he was publicly supportive of bank measures to subdue the euro zone crisis that were unpopular in Germany.\n",
      "In doing so, he presented a counterweight to officials like Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, who were highly critical of the ECB.\n",
      "In June 2013, Asmussen defended ECB policies in testimony to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany after citizens’ groups challenged their constitutionality.\n",
      "Asmussen and Weidmann gave opposing evidence to the German Constitutional Court this year in a hearing to determine the legality of the Outright Monetary Transactions program.\n",
      "Countering Weidmann's testimony, Asmussen argued the OMT program did not relieve countries of the need to reform their own economies as they would have to sign up to rescue plans monitored by the EU's bailout fund, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.\n",
      "While Weidmann argued that bond markets exert discipline on countries’ finances, Asmussen said the euro area faced break-up last year as investors began to price in an end to the currency.\n",
      "In early 2013, Asmussen represented the ECB in talks with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund over aid to Cyprus, a member of the euro zone.\n",
      "They worked out a plan that would have forced depositors to finance much of a bailout of the country's banks.\n",
      "After an outcry, they revised the plan.\n",
      "Draghi later called the plan “not smart,” an implicit rebuke to Asmussen.\n",
      "Asmussen's term at the ECB was scheduled to run until 2019.\n",
      "However, he resigned from his post to join German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government in December 2013, saying he wanted to spend more time with his partner and two young children in Berlin.\n",
      "At the time, he was mentioned in the media as a possible finance minister if the SPD had managed to grasp control of the ministry from incumbent Wolfgang Schäuble in the negotiations on a coalition government following the 2013 elections.\n",
      "State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, 2014–16\n",
      "In his position as State Secretary under Labor Minister Andrea Nahles, Asmussen oversaw the introduction of a national minimum wage.\n",
      "During a 2015 conference in Berlin, Asmussen held that \"the core of European integration for the future is the eurozone\" and argued in favor of \"a deeper federal integration of the eurozone, which would mean gradually creating new institutions such as an EU finance ministry or a eurozone budget.\"\n",
      "In late 2015, Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble reached agreement on Asmussen moving to a managerial position at Germany's state development bank KfW, which ultimately did not happen due to a disagreement with the KfW management.\n",
      "Career in the private sector\n",
      "Upon leaving politics, Amussen has taken on numerous positions on corporate boards, including the following: \n",
      " Funding Circle, non-executive director of the board\n",
      " Generali Investments Europe, independent member of the board of directors (since 2016)\n",
      " Lazard, managing  director  in  Financial  Advisory (since 2016)\n",

      "Controversy\n",
      "In a September 2014 opinion piece for Berliner Zeitung and Les Échos, Asmussen and European Central Bank executive board member Benoît Cœuré wrote that “Germany can use some of its budgetary room of maneuver to support investment and reduce tax wedges – the difference between what employers pay in wages and the total take-home pay for workers – while preserving its sound fiscal position.\n",
      "In doing so, it would tackle some its own future economic challenges.” The two officials also called on France to press ahead with labour market reforms while sticking to the budget deficit targets agreed with the European Commission.\n",
      "“The article does not reflect current government policy and we don’t agree,” a spokesperson for Germany's finance ministry said.\n",
      "Amid the German debate on extending Greece's credit plan following the election of Alexis Tsipras in early 2015, tensions in Chancellor Merkel's coalition government emerged after the Sächsische Zeitung regional newspaper reported that Asmussen had secretly reached out to Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis of Greece before an important parliamentary vote, keeping the CDU Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble out of the loop.\n",

Roosevelt's reelection for the US presidency in 1936, attending Roosevelt's visit to The College of Idaho in 1937, and competing in debate and oratory events at the Pi Kappa Delta National Tournament at Washburn University in Topeka, KS in 1938, the year of his graduation.\n",
      "During his college years, Smylie concluded that hitchhiking was \"a thoroughly respectable manner of travel,\" and would hitchhike back to Iowa in the summers.\n",
      "Career \n",
      "After graduating from law school in 1938, he moved to Washington D.C., where he simultaneously clerked at the law firm of Covington Burling, was a United States Capitol Police officer, and attended George Washington University Law School until his graduation in 1942.\n",
      "Having begun practicing law in Washington, D.C., Smylie left his practice in 1942 to join the United States Coast Guard as a lawyer and was stationed in Philadelphia and the Philippines during World War II.\n",
      "He returned to his private practice in 1946.\n",
      "Attorney general of Idaho \n",
      "In January 1947, Smylie became a deputy attorney general in Idaho, under newly elected Robert Ailshie.\n",
      "That November, Ailshie unexpectedly died of a heart attack at age 39; Smylie was appointed attorney general at age 33 by Governor C. A. Robins, and was elected to a full four-year term in 1950.\n",
      "Governor of Idaho \n",
      "Smylie ran for governor in 1954, as the seat was not eligible for re-election at the time and was held by Republican Len Jordan.\n",
      "Starting with the 1946 election, Idaho changed from two-year to four-year terms for governor, but with the change it disallowed self-succession (re-election).\n",
      "Smylie was elected governor at age forty in 1954 and successfully lobbied the 1955 legislature to propose an amendment to the state constitution to allow gubernatorial re-election, which was approved by voters in the 1956 general election.\n",
      "Smylie, the first Idaho governor born in the 20th century, was re-elected in 1958 and 1962.\n",
      "During his tenure, a state park system was created, and a sales tax adopted.\n",
      "In February 1955, following a prompt from a BBC reporter, Smylie fast-tracked legislation to remove the anomaly of Idaho being the only one of the 48 states that did not observe George Washington's Birthday as a holiday.\n",
      "While governor, Smylie served as chair of the Western Governors Association (1959–1961) and as chair of the Republican Governors Association.\n",
      "He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1960.\n",
      "Smylie served on the National Governor's Conference Executive Committee from 1956 to 1957, from 1959 to 1960, and in 1963.\n",
      "Smylie ran for a fourth term in 1966, but was soundly defeated (61–39%) in the Republican primary by his successor, Don Samuelson, whom he had encouraged to run for the state senate six years earlier.\n",
      "Smylie attributed his support of the newly implemented sales tax of three per cent in 1965 as a major factor in his defeat.\n",
      "The sales tax was easily approved by voters in the November election; it stayed at three per cent until  and is now\n",
      "\n",
      "Later career \n",
      "Leaving the governor's office after a dozen years at age 52, Smylie returned to the practice of law in 1967.\n",
      "He served as trustee, chair of trustees, and as acting president of the College of Idaho.\n",
      "1972 U.S. Senate election \n",
      "Smylie was a candidate for the 1972 United States Senate election in Idaho, but finished fourth in the Republican primary, won by Jim McClure.\n",
      "Personal life\n",
      "Smylie married Lucile Irwin on December 4, 1943, and the couple had two sons.\n",
      "Smylie died in Boise at age 89 on July 17, 2004, and his wife Lucile died less than six weeks later.\n",
      "They are interred at the Boise Pioneer Cemetery.\n",
      "Lucile's sister Virgil was the widow of D. Worth Clark, Democratic U.S.\n",

      "Greenhills Beach is an unpatrolled beach on Bate Bay, located in Greenhills Beach, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\n",
      "The beach is located roughly 18 kilometres from the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire.\n",
      "Recognised as one of Sydney's longest beaches, Greenhills beach is roughly 3 kilometres in length and forms part of a chain of beaches residing on Bate Bay.\n",
      "It is the northernmost section of the Greenhills-North Cronulla beach complex and is the only section of the beach not to be patrolled by a Surf Club or by volunteer lifesavers.\n",
      "History\n",
      "The beach's name, Greenhills, originates from the Cronulla sand dunes.\n",
      "These dunes, prior to European settlement were abundant with vegetation.\n",
      "However, within a century of European settlement, most of the original vegetation had been cleared, exposing the sand dunes.\n",
      "Many patches of tall grass and shrubs still remain on the dunes, giving a green-colored tint to the hills, thus its naming.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Greenhills Beach is the northernmost and longest section of a 4-beach complex known as Greenhills-North Cronulla, which also includes Wanda Beach, Elouera Beach and North Cronulla Beach.\n",
      "Greenhills, due to its small notoriety and lack of crowds compared to its southern neighbors, is often cited as a destination for beach-goers in Sydney and for tourists.\n",
      "The beach is also one of few beaches in Sydney to allow dogs to roam the beach, with dogs being allowed off-leash between 4pm and 10am.\n",
      "After community lobbying, the Sutherland Shire Council allowed dogs to roam the beach 24 hours a day following a decision in August 2013.\n",
      "Following two serious dog attacks on the beach, however, the new regulations were repealed after only three weeks, with the council voting to scrap the 24-hour off-leash dogs idea altogether in November 2013.\n",
      "Merries Reef\n",
      "A small reef system known as Merries Reef is located at , at the northernmost part of the beach, off the coastal rocks near Boat Harbour.\n",
      "The reef, which, since 2001, has been protected by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries as part of the Boat Harbour Aquatic Reserve, is characterised as a popular spearfishing and marine collection area.\n",
      "The reef is home to various lobsters, such as southern rock lobsters and blacklip abalones.\n",
      "Geographically, the reef also serves as a wave break, contributing to the low surf at Greenhills Beach.\n",

      "Nakhtmin (also Minnakht) held the position of generalissimo during the reign of pharaoh Tutankhamun of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt.\n",
      "His titles during the reign of Tutankhamun included \"the true servant who is beneficial to his lord, the king's scribe,\" \"the servant beloved of his lord,\" \"the Fan-bearer on the Right Side of the King,\" and \"the servant who causes to live the name of his lord.\"\n",
      "These titles were found on five ushabtis that Nakhtmin offered as funerary presents for pharaoh Tutankhamun.\n",
      "He was the heir to the throne during the reign of the pharaoh Ay though he never became a pharaoh.\n",
      "It is assumed by scholars that he died towards the end of the reign of Ay (when he seemingly vanished from all records) and Horemheb, the designated heir of Tutankhamun, became pharaoh instead.\n",
      "Crown Prince\n",
      "\n",
      "The identity of Nakhtmin's father is not known with certainty.\n",
      "Some scholars suggest that he may have been the son of pharaoh Ay, his mother being known from a statue to be the 'Adoratrix of Min, Songstress of Isis' Iuy.\n",
      "Nakhtmin appears to have been the chosen successor to Ay, but died before he could succeed.\n",
      "On a beautiful statue of Nakhtmin and his wife in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Nakhtmin was identified as the  \"Crown Prince\" (jrj-pꜥt) and \"King's Son\".\n",
      "(zꜣ-nzw) This title could be completed as \"King's Son of his own body,\" which would make him the son of Ay, or it could be completed as the \"King's Son of Kush\".\n",
      "There is no record of a Viceroy of Kush by the name of Nakhtmin, and it seems that the nobleman Paser I was Viceroy during that time period.\n",
      "This has led to the identification of Nakhtmin as Ay's son, or adopted son.\n",
      "The statue with the inscription has suffered extensive damage.\n",
      "Only two pieces remain, the head and shoulders of Nakhtmin and the upper part of the body and head of his wife.\n",
      "Both statues look as though the eyes, nose and mouth have been deliberately damaged.\n",
      "This has been interpreted as some form of persecution even after death.\n",
      "His stelae—which had been set up at his (and Ay's) native city of Akhmim—were defaced.\n",
      "It is assumed that his tomb, which was never discovered, has been given the same treatment as that of Ay.\n",
      "Another man called Nakhtmin was married to Mutemnub, the sister of Ay's wife Tey.\n",
      "They had a son named Ay, who was High Priest of Mut and Second Prophet of Amun.\n",

      "All draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\n",
      "Matches may also be played on Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of the regular Thursdays due to scheduling conflicts.\n",
      "Format\n",
      "Each tie is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home.\n",
      "The team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs progresses to the next round.\n",
      "In the event that aggregate scores finish level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses.\n",
      "If away goals are also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time are played, divided into two fifteen-minute halves.\n",
      "The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e., if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored.\n",
      "If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shootout.\n",
      "In the draw for each round, teams are seeded based on their 2011 UEFA club coefficients, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots.\n",
      "A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided randomly.\n",
      "Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds take place before the results of the previous round are known.\n",
      "The seeding in each draw is carried out under the assumption that all of the highest-ranked clubs of the previous round are victorious.\n",
      "If a lower-ranked club is victorious, it simply takes the place of its defeated opponent in the next round.\n",
      "Prior to the draw, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition, while ensuring that teams from the same association are not drawn against each other.\n",

      "This community is a progeny of the Agbon Kingdom.\n",
      "Local history has it that it is the first son of Agbon whose traditional seat of leadership is Isiokolo.\n",
      "The previous king of the community, now deceased, HRM Chamberlain Oyibocha Orovwuje, Ogurimerime Okpara I, used this community as his centre of leadership bypassing the ancient satellite of Isiokolo.\n",
      "Origins/Background\n",
      "The traditions of the origins and migrations of Okpara as one of the Urhobo groups is still shrouded in obscurity and uncertainty.\n",
      "However, Okpara claim descent from one progenitor called Agbon who is said to have migrated from Benin at a point in time to settle in Agbon town.\n",
      "Predicated upon this belief of common descent from Agbon, is the worship of Isiokoru fetish by Agbon people, even till today.\n",
      "When Agbon people finally got to Isiokolo, they made contact with Benin to make an earth fetish for them.\n",
      "The Oba sent a messenger to Agbon town, which convened a meeting of all Agbon children.\n",
      "The messenger buried the head of an Orhokpor boy in a place.\n",
      "On that spot, he planted an Iroko and Oghriki tree.\n",
      "He then proclaimed that from then on Agbon would be subject to the Oba.\n",
      "He gave a horse tail symbolizing authority to the eldest man called Okarorho.\n",
      "Automatically all the children of Agbon regarded this fetish as their god of war.\n",
      "They worshipped it from time to time.\n",
      "Moreover, the common traditions of origins and migrations shared by Okpara people is fundamental in explaining their relations in the pre-colonial era.\n",
      "This, for instance, had served as a unifying factor among them.\n",
      "In any critical moment of decision between them, they often evoke the memory of their common origins by the saying -we are all one-.\n",
      "Agbon people have a long migrational history, their various traditions and accounts of origins and migrations subsist.\n",
      "According to one of the accounts, a man called Ukonorhoro, who migrated from Udo in Benin, gave birth to Agbon.\n",
      "Agbon migrated through  Kwale, probably from Erhowa, settled at Ehwen and Erhivwi or Irri in present Isoko division of Delta State.\n",
      "From there he moved down to Utokori, close to Ughwerun; then to Olomu and through the present Ughelli territory of Ekuigbo to found Otorho r' Agbon now known as Isiokolo.\n",
      "The Okpara people further migrated from Agbon to their present position due to local instinct and avoidance of competition.\n",
      "On arrival on this new land via migration, Okpara also birthed few sons which would become sub-sections of the present community.\n",
      "They include: Eregbe, Erhi, and Etorogba.\n",
      "Erhi, in turn, gave birth to Osia, Isaba Uvwiaghoa, Onoriaro and Okei among others.\n",
      "Okpara was already dead at the time of migration from Isiokolo.\n",
      "Thus Osia and others led Okparas to a new settlement.\n",
      "Osia planted an Oghriki tree near the present site of Okpara hospital on reaching Okpara.\n",
      "The essence of this was to allow their people to make love, for the presence of the tree symbolizes that, that place was a settlement.\n",
      "It was a taboo among them, for people to make love in the bush.\n",
      "One of Osia's descendants must be the chief priest of the Oto Shrine because it was Osia who planted the Oghriki tree.\n",
      "As the population grew, both due to the birth of new immigrants like Esume, the people of Okpara began to spread out.\n",
      "Esume who was Osia's in-law founded Osia street, but because he was an in-law, the street was named after Osia.\n",
      "Omovwiona founded Urhu-iniovwona, one of Isaba's children founded Urhu-Egbo; Ogene founded Urhu-Ogene, Ononaro founded Imodje street; the descendants of Eregbe founded Eregbe quarter, and Ete-ogba children founded Ogba quarter.\n",

      "UW was the first mission assigned to United States Army Special Forces when they were formed in 1952; they now have additional missions, including foreign internal defense (FID).\n",
      "In the United States, \"special forces\" refers specifically to the United States Army Special Forces (SF), as opposed to the usage in most other countries, where \"special forces\" refers to the range of unit types that the U.S. calls \"special operations forces\" controlled by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).\n",
      "SF units are tasked with seven primary missions:\n",
      "\n",
      " unconventional warfare (United States Department of Defense doctrine) (UW)\n",
      " foreign internal defense (FID)\n",
      " special reconnaissance (SR)\n",
      " direct action (DA)\n",

      " counter-proliferation (CP)\n",
      " psychological operations (United States) (PSYOP)\n",
      " information operations (IO)\n",
      "\n",
      "SF may be given other missions including warfare and support, combat search and rescue (CSAR), security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian demining and counter-drug operations; other USSOCOM units or other U.S. government activities may be the specialists in these secondary areas.\n",
      "The UW mission assumes that U.S. forces will work with troops in another country and possibly with other allies and is always multinational.\n",
      "Depending on the particular situation, their role may vary from pure training to leading a joint force in combat.\n",
      "Over more than fifty years, roles and missions have continued to evolve, based on the history of operations.\n",
      "History\n",
      "The idea of UW came from Second World War resistance movements assisted by U.S. personnel, especially against the Empire of Japan's invasion of the Philippines as well as numerous European national resistance against the invasion by Nazi Germany.\n",
      "The main strength of these movements came not from U.S., but local personnel.\n",
      "U.S. \"behind the lines\" units such as Merrill's Marauders, in modern doctrine, were not conducting UW but DA and SR.\n",
      "The idea extended to resistance against an expected Soviet invasion of Europe following World  Rarely, however, did the U.S. create a guerrilla force.\n",
      "Far more often, the U.S. supported an existing national organization.\n",
      "World War II\n",
      "A variety of organizations, including United States personnel, conducted UW missions.\n",
      "Many of the operations in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) were multinational, such as Jedburgh teams, which usually were composed of three soldiers, one from the U.S., one from the U.K., and one from France.\n",
      "The earliest US soldiers involved in UW were in the Philippines, soon allied with Filipino forces, and who declined to follow Japanese orders to surrender, such as Wendell Fertig.\n",
      "While not trained in UW, Fertig, along with other U.S. and Filipino leaders, eventually created guerrilla forces fighting the Japanese, forces that numbered in the tens of thousands.\n",
      "A few experienced soldiers' ability to train and lead a quite large resistance was a guiding principle of the formation of United States Army Special Forces in 1952.\n",
      "1950s model of resistance to invasion of Europe\n",
      "After World War II, the original SF mission of UW, as shown in the first SF deployment of the 10th Special Forces Group to Europe, was in expectation of a Soviet attack on Western Europe.\n",
      "SF would help organize, train, and lead resistance movements to such an invasion.\n",
      "A 1951 doctrine for UW, still called guerrilla warfare at that point, was:\n",
      "\n",
      "1960s model of dealing with wars of national liberation\n",
      "When American advisors were sent to Laos and South Vietnam in the fifties and early sixties, the major problem was not to create guerrilla units, but to fight existing Laotian and Vietnamese guerrilla forces.\n",
      "To them it seemed logical that soldiers trained to be guerrillas would have a deep understanding of how to fight  guerrillas, so Special Forces was given that mission.\n",
      "The White Star mission in Laos was initially covert, and used Special Forces and other personnel under Central Intelligence Agency control.\n",
      "Whether the mission is called counterguerrilla, counterinsurgency, or foreign internal defense, it involves assisting a friendly government—the \"foreign\" in FID—to defend against guerrillas acting inside its borders.\n",
      "FID can also involve training a foreign government to deal with a future internal guerrilla threat.\n",
      "Later in Southeast Asia, SF personnel, often assigned to the Studies and Observation Group, carried out SR missions against infiltrators from the North, directing air strikes and assessing damage.\n",
      "1970s and 1980s\n",
      "In the 1970s, until the NCA withdrew them as part of its \"tilt\" to Iraq, SF supported Kurdish resistance to Iraq under Saddam Hussein.\n",
      "In the 1980s, SF worked with the Afghan Mujahideen against the Soviets, but in a role of supporting rather than leading the local personnel.\n",
      "They did not need to create an underground and an auxiliary, and often supported the guerrillas from outside the area of operations.\n",
      "Parts of the Afghan resistance, supported by SF and CIA elements, later became hostile to the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "1990s\n",
      "Following the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, SF teams worked with the Kuwaiti resistance.\n",
      "When they can direct, using long-distance secure communications, air and missile strikes on targets, the guerrillas need not risk their limited resources in raids and ambushes.\n",
      "While U.S. special operations doctrine had conceived of guiding strikes, that was seen as being done directly by SF specialists.\n",
      "The evolving model would have SF UW trainers teach the guerrillas how to guide strikes against targets.\n",
      "Separating the means of destruction from the guerrillas not only makes them safer, but avoids the problem of \"blowback\" if the guerrillas later turn against the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "2000s\n",
      "In the 2001 joint operations with the Afghan Northern Alliance, the SF teams with the Afghans provided the precision targeting information to air units, but did not operate in a SR mode, separate from the local force.\n",
      "The SR targeting function was performed, but in a UW support context rather than a separate U.S. operation.\n",
      "SF produced intelligence for their own operations, for their supported regional command, and national-level authorities.\n",
      "\"Arriving in their operational areas, SF cultivated relationships with local leaders citizens of the area, much as in the Balkans.\"\n",
      "Their mission was neither pure UW nor pure FID, but the intelligence preparation featured in the fifth step, Buildup, of the operational model.\n",
      "Evolution of the UW mission\n",
      "In 1998, Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, then USSOCOM commander and later Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Robert E. Kelley \"Unconventional warfare is not a viable mission for Special Forces.\n",
      "The only reason you train for unconventional warfare is because it is the best vehicle for maintaining your Special Forces skill set.\"\n",
      "Kelley also cites the October 1997 Army Special Forces Vision XXI as saying \"Dissident elements are the key to UW mission potential in any region.\n",
      "As long as there are dissidents, there will be UW potential to support U.S. national interest.\"\n",
      "Gen. Schoomaker, however, did use the term global scouts to describe the role that Special Forces have in \"preparing the battlefield\" before regular forces enter it.\n",
      "While the later stages of UN operations in Somalia suffered from overly ambitious goals resulting in the Battle of Mogadishu, SF teams preceded the United States Marine Corps unit that formed the first overt assistance force, and made contact with various clans whose cooperation was needed.\n",
      "Such contact falls into the early parts of the UW operational model, without moving into combat phases.\n",
      "Other than special reconnaissance, such information collection is not now listed as a basic SF mission.\n",
      "Kelley suggests that the SF UW doctrine be revised to include just such activity:\n",
      "\n",
      " Intelligence activities in a UW environment should be the first area addressed: Schoomaker's global scout role.\n",
      "This can fit into existing UW doctrine if it is understood the resistance may never need to engage in direct combat.\n",
      "Employment of subversion and sabotage needs to be made a priority, and updated.\n",
      "The update should emphasize that direct access and violent means may not be necessary if, for example, communications and computers can be disrupted by remote information operations.\n",
      "SF units already have assisted insurgencies as diverse as the Contras and Northern Alliance.\n",
      "A support, rather than leadership, role has not been formulated in SF UW doctrine.\n",
      "Complete the revision of UW doctrine to take a more modern view of guerrilla warfare, in contrast with the current model that emphasizes World  leadership of rural partisans.\n",
      "Kelley concluded that UW remains a viable mission, but the doctrine for it, as of 2000, is outdated.\n",
      "It has been relatively rare that U.S. forces, since World  actually trained and led a guerrilla force.\n",
      "They did so in Laos, but, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, they supported an existing rebel force.\n",
      "For example, UW missions were sometimes initiated by paramilitary personnel of the Central Intelligence Agency, sometimes with SF personnel on clandestine detail to the CIA.\n",
      "See CIA activities in Laos.\n",
      "Eventually, these UW forces came back under U.S. Army control.\n",
      "Later in the Vietnam War, SF-led units conducted offensive actions against opponents on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and other infiltration paths.\n",
      "Increasingly, SF personnel took on other missions, principally SR and DA.\n",
      "In 1990–91, the UW mission supported intelligence collection, sabotage, and subversion by the Kuwaiti underground.\n",
      "UW had a major role, in 2001, of supporting the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.\n",
      "UW experience is more of support to intelligence collection, subversion and sabotage by insurgents, and less one of direct combat through raids and ambushes.\n",
      "Current doctrine allows both; there may need to be a change of emphasis.\n",
      "Strategic role of UW\n",
      "Unconventional warfare is a form of insurgency, which exploits grievances to influence or overthrow a government believed repressive by the supporters of the UW force.\n",
      "US doctrine assumes there will usually be a government in exile with which the UW plan can be developed.\n",
      "UW leaders must never forget that they are extending politics with military means, and that, in a guerrilla situation, their military means are limited.\n",
      "Successful UW always recognizes that its essence is political, not simply military.\n",
      "No warfare should ignore Carl von Clausewitz's dictum that \"war is the extension of politics with the addition of other means\".\n",
      "Subversion, psychological operations and other nonviolent means may be as potent as an ambush, in advancing the political goals of the UW force.\n",
      "The U.S. doctrine for special operations emphasizes that commanders cannot dominate a politicomilitary environment in the same way in which a conventional force can exert \"battlefield dominance.\"\n",
      "UW is conceptually at a strategic level, and its commanders must constantly remain aware of political goals such as  \"military successor defeat, a change in hostile strategy or tactics, or fluctuating levels of US support.\n",
      "They must know who the friendly and hostile decision makers are, what their objectives and strategies are, and how they interact.\n",
      "They must influence friendly decision makers to ensure they understand the implications of SO mission requirements and the consequences of not adequately supporting them.\"\n",
      "Relationships with U.S. National Command\n",
      "The ability to create or support resistance forces expands the range of options available to national leadership, filling a niche intermediate between diplomacy and all-out warfare.\n",
      "As the Cold War began, the focus was on Europe, but it began to expand.\n",
      "Faced the reality of wars of national liberation from the mid-fifties on, President John F. Kennedy gave the first public endorsement to Special Forces, as a means of countering Communist expansion in the third world, a very different problem than the original UW concept of leading resistance movements after a Soviet invasion of Europe.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Operational SF personnel assigned to a Unified Combatant Command (UCC) or USSOCOM reports to the National Command Authority (NCA) of the United States (i.e., the President of the United States and the United States Secretary of Defense).\n",
      "Other national-level organizations, such as the United States Department of State or the Director of National Intelligence, may have a role in establishing policy for the UW operation, which is under the direct command of a joint organization made up of U.S. and Government in Exile personnel.\n",
      "Personnel qualified in the UW mission provided the NCA and UCC commanders with \"a flexible, highly trained military force ready for small-scale, complex, high-risk missions inside hostile states.\n",
      "Throughout its history, SF's core purpose has been unconventional warfare (UW) and although light infantry and paramilitary units may employ UW tactics, SOF remain the only doctrinally trained UW experts\".\n",
      "UW as a source of intelligence\n",
      "UW forces have intelligence capability for their own targeting, but also are major sources of intelligence to the commands they support, and to the national level of the United States and the supported government in exile.\n",
      "This is a two-way process; the higher headquarters can provide appropriate national-level intelligence and guidance on targeting, while the UW forces can conduct intelligence collection.\n",
      "The local forces have language and cultural skills to blend with an enemy while conducting reconnaissance.\n",
      "Underground and auxiliary forces can clandestinely emplace SIGINT and MASINT technical collection devices.\n",
      "Intelligence operation pioneered during Special Forces operations in Bosnia and Kosovo continued their evolution during Afghanistan and Iraq.\n",
      "\"Analysis of the operations conducted by Special Forces from the Balkans to OEF and OIF demonstrate a distinct trend away from the traditional \"top-driven\" intelligence, gathered and evaluated at higher command levels and disseminated to lower units, to a \"bottom-driven\" intelligence system based upon collection and exploitation of information at the user level.\n",
      "Intelligence organizations at higher command levels were not always organized to make the best use of SF-collected intelligence.\n",
      "Direct effects of the COE include personnel and training changes resulting from the increased emphasis on ... intelligence and information technologies for SF to operate effectively in the joint, multinational, and interagency environment.\n",
      "Indirect effects of the COE include increases in command and control, combat support, and combat service support assets required to conduct multiple, sustained special operations globally.\n",
      "SF, UW, and force multiplication\n",
      "SF units are force multipliers.\n",
      "While SF have missions other than UW, UW can more impact when they can create a much larger force of guerrillas rather than trying to do everything themselves.\n",
      "An effective SF commander had the attitude,   \"Hey, we're all in this together with our Kurdish counterparts,\"... Our commander and his counterpart ... were very close and like-minded, to the point that they would show up together for JSOTF coordination and planning meetings ...\n",
      "In fact, I would say that what they were seeing was genuine rapport and a real camaraderie.\n",
      "In our sector, the Kurds had a standing order not to allow any Americans to get killed, and thus they surrounded our ODAs during combat.\"\n",
      "Operational model of UW\n",
      "At the operational level, the UW force, prepares the battlefield for other units and conducts operations on conditions favorable to it.\n",
      "SF must constantly be ready to adapt, and to use the political insights of guerrilla warfare theorists whose ideology might be quite different from theirs:\n",
      "\n",
      "Relationships with theater-level command\n",
      "In most cases, the AO will be within the scope of a U.S. regional Unified Combatant Command (UCC), and the UW force will be part of the special operations organization subordinate to that Command.\n",
      "There may be rare circumstances in which the SF operation is controlled at national level, with USSOCOM retaining command.\n",
      "A U.S. Joint Special Operations Task Force is \"joint\" in the sense that it contains components from different branches of the U.S. military.\n",
      "The JSOTF may also include personnel, perhaps on exchange assignments, from countries with which the U.S. has especially close relationships.\n",
      "There may be multiple Joint Task Forces (JTF) in a theater, which contain both regular and special operations forces under a JTF commander.\n",
      "Alternatively, the geographic combatant commander can authorize the theater special operations command (SOC) to establish JSOTFs for pure special operations, based on area of operations or type of operation (e.g., UW versus FID).\n",
      "Security may dictate that the JSOTF not be on the ground of one of the countries within the geographic region.\n",
      "Especially when the JSOTF has a significant naval component (e.g., while a direct action (DA) mission, Operation Prime Chance headquarters was afloat), the JSOTF headquarters may be afloat.\n",
      "Using advanced communications, the formal headquarters may stay in the United States, with a \"forward\" command post in the area of operations.\n",
      "Both of these choices can help deal with situations where it might be awkward for the host nation, or the nation hosting the government in exile, to have a U.S. headquarters on its soil.\n",
      "In the organizational chart, the pink horizontal lines show multinational relationships; in practice, at least some of those pink lines will actually represent multinational headquarters operations.\n",
      "The lower the organization level, the more likely a multinational headquarters will exist.\n",
      "Sometimes, the resistance organization already controls part of the AO.\n",
      "Still, there usually will be some liaison personnel that can meet with the regional U.S. planners.\n",
      "If the UW operation is planned to support conventional operations (e.g., the French Resistance started a preplanned series of attacks on German transportation about 48 hours before the Normandy Invasion), UW control may be passed to SF officers attached to the supported conventional force.\n",
      "Army Special Operations Task Force (ARSOTF) describes an Army command, with a SF or Ranger core plus attachments, that deals with specific operations in a UCC.\n",
      "It is typically based on a SF Group or Ranger Regiment.\n",
      "Since countries are assigned to UCCs, the government in exile will work with both American diplomats and an appropriate level of SF organization.\n",
      "A SF Battalion, subordinate to a Group, may command all SF operations in a medium-sized country, or a region of a larger one, from a Forward Operating Base (FOB).\n",
      "Company-level headquarters called Advanced Operating Bases (AOB) supplement FOB capabilities.\n",
      "The Seven-Step Operational Model\n",
      "\n",
      "A SF UW campaign is now defined to have seven steps, ending in combat and demobilization.\n",
      "Changing concepts in UW, however, may change the model so that the UW force avoids entering the main combat phase, but carries out critical support operations with the steps before it.\n",
      "Preparation\n",
      "Much of the early steps may take place in a safe area outside the AO, where SF, as well as psychological operations personnel from USSOCOM, the United States Department of State, the Central Intelligence Agency, and other organizations establish contacts with sympathizers in the target country.\n",
      "A wide range of psychological operations techniques are used to increase the likelihood that citizens of the target country will be sympathetic.\n",
      "Such operations can range from overt (i.e., \"white propaganda\") radio and television broadcasts, to clandestine material purporting to be issued by the opposition (i.e., \"black propaganda\").\n",
      "Initial contact\n",
      "Small units or individuals, typically from SF or CIA, make clandestine contact with leaders in the AO, and gain agreement that SF teams will be welcomed.\n",
      "For example, in Afghanistan in 2001, CIA paramilitary personnel made the initial contact with leaders of the Northern Alliance, who agreed to accept SF teams that would train and fight with the Afghan resistance.\n",
      "CIA personnel had been in Afghanistan, in noncombat roles, certainly as early as 1999, and had created relationships that could not have been established under the military roles and missions of the time.\n",
      "Infiltration\n",
      "SF operational detachments enter the AO, by clandestine means, such as parachuting at night (especially using HAHO or HALO techniques), delivery by naval special operations vessels or from submarines, by out-of-uniform infiltration from a neighboring country, sub-surface infiltration utilizing closed circuit dive gear (combat diver), etc.\n",
      "If the infiltrating party is to be met by local supporters, there must be pre-agreed recognition signals.\n",
      "Should the infiltrators not be able to find their local contacts, they should have a variety of backup plans, ranging from establishing a clandestine base and waiting for contact, or to be recovered by their own side.\n",
      "Early in an insurgency, electronic communications should be avoided, as enemy SIGINT might learn of activities simply by detecting an unexpected radio signal.\n",
      "Couriers and personal meetings are resistant to SIGINT, but also have problems of maintaining physical security.\n",
      "Organization\n",
      "Citizen soldiers of the guerrilla force, underground and auxiliary are trained and equipped for their intended roles.\n",
      "SF personnel, possibly supplemented with communications and security experts in the AO, as well as support organizations outside the country, create the clandestine cell system to be used by hidden units.\n",
      "In this phase and later phases, SF medical personnel often work to improve the health of their sympathizers.\n",
      "Buildup\n",
      "The operation increases recruiting, and may begin clandestine intelligence collection and subversion, and possibly some hit-and-run raids and ambushes that have a high probability of success and a low risk of compromising security.\n",
      "Another covert operational technique, which may be used during this phase, is placing improvised explosive devices (i.e., mines and boobytraps).\n",
      "Sabotage, such as placing an explosive charge under a railroad track, is easier to hide than a raid on the train.\n",
      "If there is aerial bombing of targets, it can be used as a cover for sabotage activities.\n",
      "Forces that have reached this level have significant intelligence collection, sabotage and subversion, and fire direction capabilities.\n",
      "Employment\n",
      "In the combat phase, the guerrilla force increases the tempo of operations, in a manner consistent with its own safety and security, until the government falls or the guerrilla force links up with conventional forces.\n",
      "See raids and ambushes for the classic guerrilla combat operations, which may not be appropriate for the changing operational environment.\n",
      "Transition\n",
      "A stable country will no longer have autonomous guerrillas.\n",
      "The guerrilla force may form the nucleus of a new military, come under the control of the new national government, or go back to civilian life.\n",
      "It is essential that these experienced soldiers support, not oppose, the new government.\n",
      "Tactics\n",
      "UW is asymmetric warfare, which attempts to meet a conventional force under conditions that optimize the UW force's strengths; UW forces avoid combat when conditions are unfavorable to them.\n",
      "Since UW and other special operations may precede operations by other military components (e.g., regular ground forces, air and missile attacks, etc.\n",
      "), friendly fire is a serious concern, since the special operation may be highly classified, such that the other components are not aware of the UW operation or its location.\n",
      "Deconfliction is the military term for avoiding fratricide, and it is the responsibility of the JSOTF commander, who must balance operations security (OPSEC) against the need for other components to know where they may operate freely.\n",
      "The basic mechanism for deconfliction is establishing a Joint Special Operations Area (JSOA), defined by the overall joint force commander (JFC).\n",
      "While establishment of a designated JSOA for SOF to conduct independent operations assists in the ease of control of SO and the prevention of fratricide, the JFC should always evaluate the value of isolating SOF against the greater benefit of integrating SOF into the overall campaign plan.\n",
      "Interdiction is the basic UW combat activity, which uses a variety of tactics to \"drain the hostile power's morale and resources, disrupt its administration, and maintain the civilian population's morale and will to resist.\"\n",
      "UW attacks should be unpredictable, but widely dispersed and occasionally against a target previously struck, so the enemy must disperse his forces.\n",
      "Even in a guerrilla context, the dispersion of hostile forces may become so great that the guerrillas can temporarily gain a local superiority of force.\n",
      "No target should be attacked without a specific reason for doing so; the selected targets should be part of neutralizing a system of targets.\n",
      "For example, if it is known that the enemy has limited supplies of fuel, attacks against tanker trucks, pipelines, refineries, and storage farms all contribute to damaging his petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) system.\n",
      "If POL is deemed the critical target system, other attacks support the attacks on POL.\n",
      "If an attack on a barracks will draw away soldiers that otherwise might guard POL resources, such an attack is both diversionary and supportive of the main attack on a critical resource.\n",
      "Basic field operations model\n",
      "In SF doctrine, an operational UW force, made up of U.S. and local personnel, has three general components, although they may not all be part of a specific mission:\n",
      "\n",
      " guerrilla force that engages in direct combat with enemy forces.\n",
      "Depending on the situation, this force may be full-time or part-time, and often stays hidden when not in combat.\n",
      "underground, a mixture of covert and clandestine functions.\n",
      "Covert functions include sabotage and psychological warfare.\n",
      "Clandestine missions include intelligence gathering and helping key personnel escape from the area of operation.\n",
      "auxiliary, whose activities should remain clandestine.\n",
      "Its functions include supply, transportation, acquisition or manufacture of weapons, recruiting, counter-intelligence, reception of personnel and equipment arriving clandestinely, medical services, finance, etc.\n",
      "This support organization can be urban or rural.\n",
      "Especially in urban warfare, the guerrilla force and underground may be integrated.\n",
      "Targeting\n",
      "Detailed targeting may be conducted by separate special reconnaissance or other special operations intelligence resources.\n",
      "The UW unit, however, will almost certainly identify and prioritize targets on its own.\n",
      "One relevant U.S. doctrine is identified by the CARVER mnemonic, although CARVER tends to emphasize air, artillery, direct action raids rather than UW:\n",
      "\n",
      " Criticality: How important, in a strategic context, is the target?\n",
      "What effect will its destruction have on other elements of the target system?\n",
      "Is it more important to have real-time surveillance of the target (e.g., a road junction) than its physical destruction?\n",
      "Accessibility: Can an SR team reach or sense the target, keep it under surveillance for the appropriate time, and then exfiltrate after the target is struck?\n",
      "Recuperability: When the target is destroyed by fire support or direct action, in the case of DA missions, can the enemy repair, replace, or bypass it quickly,  minimum resources?\n",
      "If so, it may not be a viable target.\n",
      "Vulnerability: do SR (including DA) and supporting units have the capability to destroy the target?\n",
      "Effect: Beyond pure military effect, what are the political, economic, legal, and psychological effects of destroying the target?\n",
      "How would the attack affect local civilians?\n",
      "Recognizability: Can the target be recognized clearly, by SR and attack forces, under the prevailing weather, light, and in its terrain?\n",
      "If there are critical points within the target, they also must be recognizable by the means of destruction used.\n",
      "Major target systems vulnerable to UW interdiction operations include railway, highway, waterway, airway, communication, power, water supply, fuel supply, and air defense systems.\n",
      "Means of interdiction\n",
      "To interdict enemy operations, the resistance can use direct combat means such as raids and ambushes.\n",
      "They can also use methods less risky to their security, such as mining or long-range sniping.\n",
      "Raids and ambushes\n",
      "Raids are short-duration attacks on objectives, with the specific understanding that the attacking force will withdraw quickly after achieving the mission objective, or finding they are confronting forces too strong to handle.\n",
      "UW raids can be simply to disrupt an enemy force, to capture usable equipment, for taking prisoners for intelligence exploitation, and destroying installations.\n",
      "Both for attacking strong points at a distance, and for destroying reinforced structures, SF may use missiles, typically derived from antitank weapons.\n",
      "When the raiding force can access the key target, they often use explosives, manually placed so that a small amount can do maximum damage.\n",
      "Certain targets, such as bridges, historically could be attacked only by manually placed explosives.\n",
      "With the advent of precision-guided munitions, the destructive part of the raid may involve the SF unit controlling air strikes.\n",
      "Air strikes, however, are practical only when U.S. involvement is not hidden.\n",
      "Where a raid goes to the enemy and attacks, an ambush waits for enemy forces to come to it, and then engages in combat.\n",
      "A well-planned ambush can have the element of surprise, possibly achieve temporary local superiority, fight from cover, and have preplanned withdrawal routes to avoid being encircled.\n",
      "Mining and sniping support both raids and ambushes.\n",
      "In a raid, mines may be laid near the enemy reaction force barracks.\n",
      "Snipers can take out critical equipment (e.g., floodlights, radars, artillery) or commanders as the raid begins.\n",
      "Both methods can discourage pursuit while the raid or ambush force withdraws.\n",
      "Mining and improvised explosive devices\n",
      "In guerrilla warfare, a great number of casualties are caused by mines and other destructive devices that are triggered by some mechanical interaction between a person and the detonation mechanism of the device.\n",
      "Since such devices rarely have a means of distinguishing between a combatant and a noncombatant, there is a very real risk to civilians, and continues to be in areas of the world where there has been much guerrilla warfare.\n",
      "The United States has not ratified the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, known informally as the Ottawa Treaty.\n",
      "It does promulgate policies and Rules of Engagement for their use.\n",
      "When an explosive device is triggered only by the action of a member of the guerrilla force after identifying a legal target, as with the command-detonated mode of the M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine, the device is not considered a mine within the context of the Ottawa Treaty.\n",
      "Such devices often are used to initiate combat in an ambush, combining surprise with an intense burst of fragments.\n",
      "U.S. policy states that a directional mine of this type may be emplaced if:\n",
      "\n",
      " They are not left out longer than 72 hours.\n",
      "The Claymores are located in the immediate proximity of the military unit that emplaced them.\n",
      "The area is monitored by military personnel to ensure civilians stay out of the area.\n",
      "A common use of mines in guerrilla warfare, however, would be to emplace them behind a retreating guerrilla force, so the pursuit force would trigger them.\n",
      "Modern mines disarm themselves after a period of time, but the majority of both purpose-built and improvised mines do not and present the chief humanitarian concern.\n",
      "U.S. policy commits to stop using manufactured mines, which do not automatically disarm, by 2010 \"with exception for use for mine action/demining training and research purposes.\n",
      "The US no longer uses non-detectable land mines of any type\", although these restrictions all apply to mines manufactured by the United States.\n",
      "The use of improvised mines and boobytraps, however, is a continuing issue.\n",
      "Since a guerrilla force expects to have the population become increasingly loyal to it, there is an obvious psychological problem with leaving an area with active explosive devices.\n",
      "Especially when a guerrilla force has limited supplies, there is tactical utility to improvising devices, which could be as simple as a hand grenade, fastened next to a trail, and with a taut wire attached to the activating lever of the grenade.\n",
      "Stepping on the wire would pull out the safety ring and start the detonation sequence of the grenade.\n",
      "SF policy does not clearly address this type of device, or those made completely from local materials and having no automatic disarming features.\n",
      "The U.S. Rules of Engagement might ban such devices, but, especially in urban or jungle areas where the guerrillas are not constantly observed, the ban might not be enforced.\n",
      "Sniping\n",
      "Snipers, when the term is used properly, are highly skilled riflemen that use specialized weapons and tactics to attack specific personnel and equipment far outside normal rifle range.\n",
      "SF sniper training is separate from the training of snipers assigned to conventional units; the USSOCOM sniper school is at Fort Bragg, NC while the general Army school is at Fort Benning, GA.\n",
      "In most circumstances, SF snipers use the same rifles as other Army snipers:\n",
      "\n",
      " 7.62 mm for ranges under 1 kilometer\n",
      " M24 7.62 mm sniper weapon system, based on the commercial Remington M700 rifle\n",
      " .50 caliber for ranges over 1 kilometer, especially for materiel targets:\n",
      " M107/M88, a bolt-action rifle that is the standard sniper rifle for U.S. Navy special operations\n",
      " M82A1, a semiautomatic rifle used by conventional units\n",
      "\n",
      "Sabotage and subversion\n",
      "Both sabotage and subversion are means to reduce the military, political, economic, or morale strengths of an opponent.\n",
      "They differ in that sabotage involves physical damage or damage to information systems, while subversion relies more on changing the behavior of personnel trusted by the opponent.\n",
      "Before the act of sabotage or subversion is executed, preparations for the act must be kept under tight security control.\n",
      "Only a small information leak could defeat the attack.\n",
      "When sabotage takes place, it may be covert rather than clandestine, in that the enemy knows he has been hurt, but may not know who hurt him.\n",
      "In the more subtle examples of sabotage, however, the enemy may not suspect deliberate action caused an aircraft to crash.\n",
      "Where the saboteur might contaminate aircraft fuel, the aircraft could be put out of service by a clerk committing subversion, by delaying or losing maintenance orders, resupply of fuel or munitions, or \"misrouting\" an order for the aircraft to attack.\n",
      "Sabotage\n",
      "The U.S. defines sabotage as \"an act or acts with intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of a country by willfully injuring or destroying, or attempting to injure or destroy, any national defense or war materiel, premises, or utilities, to include human and natural resources.\"\n",
      "In a more modern context, sabotage may be one of many ways to attack a given enemy target system.\n",
      "If, for example, the POL target system is targeted, tank farms and refineries could be raided, or pipelines and tanker trucks ambushed or attacked with mines.\n",
      "These will be very evident to the enemy, and the resistance could be damaged if some of their combat teams are captured and interrogated.\n",
      "If a saboteur were able to gain access to that tank farm, or fuel tanks of vehicles and aircraft, and add a chemical that slowly damaged engines, that agent could be far away by the time the enemy determines what had happened.\n",
      "Carefully planned sabotage can be one of the safest tactics for an UW force.\n",
      "Sabotage is usually carried out clandestinely by the underground or auxiliary, but it can be carried out by the guerrilla force, under the cover of a combat operation.\n",
      "For example, while a raid on an airfield was in progress, and all available guards were fighting the main raid, guerrillas might infiltrate to the fuel tank farm and introduce contaminants into some of the tanks.\n",
      "SF teams must take great care, especially in failed or failing states with crumbling infrastructure, not to enable dissidents to create hardship for the general population.\n",
      "An excellent example, which reflects societal characteristics that might not be obvious to Americans, is sabotaging an airfield that provides a widely used commodity that must be fresh, such as khat in Somalia.\n",
      "Subversion\n",
      "Subversion is formally defined as \"action designed to undermine the military, economic, psychological, or political strength or morale of a regime.\"\n",
      "In an insurgency, it will almost certainly be carried out by members of the underground or auxiliary, who have gained the trust of the enemy.\n",
      "Support to the UW force\n",
      "\n",
      "Strike support\n",
      "In the organization chart, there is a dotted line to the UCC air command, which normally controls both Air Force and Navy aircraft in the region, and may have air assets based in the U.S. detailed to them.\n",
      "The military staff of the guerrilla government might, assuming U.S. involvement is known, request a U.S. air strike on some target that the guerrillas cannot destroy, or perhaps even reach.\n",
      "Such strikes are not a panacea, as an air strike with civilian casualties will turn the essential political dynamic against the guerrilla force.\n",
      "Communications\n",
      "Communications security is critical.\n",
      "New Special Forces software-defined radios, such as the AN/PRC-148 Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Inter/Intra Team Radio (JITR) are easily portable, secure and flexible, but capture of such a unit, in the early phases of an operation, confirms U.S. involvement.\n",
      "Tactical radios used internally by the UW force are even more vulnerable to capture.\n",
      "When U.S. involvement is known, however, the latest technology is routinely used.\n",
      "As a consequence, SF communications specialists must be competent with old but deniable radio communications, including those using Morse Code or field-improvised antennas in the high frequency (HF) range.\n",
      "Intelligence support to UW forces\n",
      "All levels of SF operational detachment have some intelligence collection and analysis capability.\n",
      "Where appropriate, SF has two standing types of teams for intelligence augmentation, one for SIGINT/secure communication and one for counterintelligence.\n",
      "The SF SIGINT unit is the Support Operations Team-Alpha.\n",
      "Sensitive intelligence sources and methods may not be shared, although the information learned through these sources and methods will be shared.\n",
      "This is not a U.S.-only rule; while the U.S. may not share the details of technical methods such as SIGINT, the guerrilla government may have extremely sensitive information sources.\n",
      "During the Vietnam War, for example, the general U.S. rule was that Vietnamese allies could see only SIGINT information that had a SECRET or lower classification, and that did not carry the additional restriction \"handle through COMINT channels only\".\n",
      "Logistics\n",
      "Logistical support for all U.S. special operations come from two lines of command: USSOCOM provides \"SO-peculiar support to SOF units worldwide.\"\n",
      "An example of SO-peculiar support would be providing Soviet-bloc ammunition if the guerrillas already have weapons that need it.\n",
      "The UCC commander, however, has overall responsibility for all joint support in his theater.\n",
      "The JSOTF logistics officer (J-4) is responsible for using the extraordinary procurement mechanisms legislatively authorized for USSOCOM, and making sure they are used appropriately.\n",
      "Note that dotted lines run from the underground and auxiliary to Navy and Air special operations units under the UCC Special Operations commander.\n",
      "These indicate that resupply might be brought in by sea or air, and the UW force will use other than the guerrilla force to receive them.\n",
      "Indeed, the guerrillas might make a diversionary attack to draw attention from the logistics or other vulnerable operation.\n",
      "SF commands, at battalion and above, have service detachments, tailored to specific missions.\n",
      "The SF support detachment has the responsibility for delivering supplies to the UW units in the field, by means specific to the situation, ranging from clandestine parachuting to armed conventional convoy crossing to the AO.\n",
      "Title 10 United States Code, Section 167, vests the SOCOM commander with the responsibility and the authority for the development and acquisition of SO-peculiar equipment, materiel, supplies and services—items needed for SO activities; for which there is no service-common requirement; or which the SOCOM commander deems as critically urgent for the immediate accomplishment of an SO activity.\n",
      "Supplies may be provided by the host nation or private companies within it, if such acquisition is consistent with operational security and mission-specific requirements.\n",
      "This function is centralized under the JSOTF J-4, but civil affairs personnel may provide the actual interface to local providers.\n",

      "The Anglo-African was a newspaper published in the British Colony of Lagos between 1863 and 1865.\n",
      "It was founded by Jamaican-born American emigrant Robert Campbell using a printing press he had brought from the United States as part of a plan to set up a settlement for black emigrants.\n",
      "The newspaper was opposed by the British governor, Henry Stanhope Freeman, who attempted to impose a tax upon it.\n",
      "History \n",
      "The newspaper was founded by Jamaican-born American emigrant Robert Campbell.\n",
      "He had arrived in Lagos with his family in 1862 intending to establish a settlement at Abeokuta for black emigrants from the United States.\n",
      "With little interest during the American Civil War and with local opposition Campbell gave up his plans and settled in Lagos.\n",
      "He decided to establish a newspaper using a printing press he had brought for the colony.\n",
      "The Anglo-African was the first newspaper to be published in Lagos.\n",
      "The first edition appeared on 6 June 1863, and the paper was published weekly until December 1865.\n",
      "The title reflected Campbell's ethos that the development of Africa must be preceded by the spread of English civilization.\n",
      "The paper found a reasonably large audience in Lagos, particularly among emigrants from the Colony of Sierra Leone.\n",
      "It consisted of four pages of local and international news, short stories, poems, serialized novels and advertisements.\n",
      "The Anglo-African was opposed by the British authorities in Lagos who feared it would cause ill-feeling between different factions in the colony.\n",
      "The governor of Lagos, Henry Stanhope Freeman, wrote to the Colonial Secretary, Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle, to propose that a punitive tax be introduced on newspapers to hinder its distribution.\n",
      "Freeman cited the effects of local newspapers in Sierra Leone: \"Your Grace must be perfectly aware of the unfortunate disputes and ill feeling which the worse than worthless periodicals published at the other Colonies on the Coast have caused: and of the injury done by the foolish and ill-judged articles inserted in a little paper printed by the Missionaries at Abeokuta\".\n",
      "Freeman suggested that a single government-controlled newspaper, exempt from the tax, might be established.\n",
      "Newcastle rejected this proposal, noting that a similar scheme in Sierra Leone, in which The New Era had been brought under government control, had led to ill feeling.\n",
      "Freeman tried to exert some control over The Anglo-African by taking out extensive advertisements within it.\n",
      "In response to complaints that this undermined its independence Campbell wrote that such advertisements would not affect his opinions on matters in the colony.\n",

      "Rajnarayan Chandavarkar (1953 – 23 April 2006) was a reader in the history and politics of South Asia and fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n",
      "Background \n",
      "Chandavarkar's work engaged most directly with the processes involved in the formation of the industrial working classes in Mumbai.\n",
      "He worked toward defining a new interdisciplinary approach for understanding processes of urbanisation, the nexus between the city and the countryside, and the evolution of industrial capitalism.\n",
      "His insights prompted research on a wide range of topics in South Asian social history and politics.\n",
      "This was particularly evident in the work of the research students whom he supervised at Cambridge.\n",
      "A new generation of scholars, who now work in India, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, the United States and Canada owes much of its achievements to his mentorship.\n",
      "As a participant in seminars at Cambridge, in international conferences, and in other forms of academic gatherings, he provided inspiration for scholars in fields far removed from his own.\n",
      "Chandavarkar grew up in Bombay before going to England for his advanced education.\n",
      "He completed the final years of his schooling at Lancing College in West Sussex.\n",
      "The rest of his academic career was closely connected to the University of Cambridge in England and to the city of Mumbai.\n",
      "He did his undergraduate studies at Gonville and Caius College from 1973 to 1976, where he was deeply influenced by Gareth Stedman Jones, his undergraduate supervisor.\n",
      "He went on to finish his PhD under the direction of Anil Seal at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n",
      "He became a fellow at Trinity in 1979, and remained associated with the college until his death.\n",
      "He has also served as the director of the Centre for South Asian Studies at Cambridge since 2001.\n",
      "Despite his lifelong association with Cambridge, he maintained strong ties with India, retaining his Indian citizenship, returning frequently to visit and do research, and participating directly in circles related to his intellectual interests, his social commitments and cricket.\n",
      "Beginning his research on Mumbai during the late 1970s, he quickly developed a strong command over the resources available in libraries such as the India Office Library, the Maharashtra State Archives and the Mumbai Police Archives.\n",
      "While he devoured historical materials, he never worshipped 'facts'.\n",
      "He interrogated his records, deconstructed evidence critically, and sought to unravel the wider social and political processes his data revealed.\n",
      "He thus moved far beyond the narrow confinement of a straightforward \"empiricism\".\n",
      "Nonetheless he was suspicious of any research not based upon the rigorous analysis of archival materials, and he exhorted his students to ground themselves solidly in their sources.\n",
      "Rajnarayan Chandavarkar died of a sudden heart attack on 23 April 2006 at the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.\n",
      "He had been attending a conference at nearby Dartmouth College.\n",
      "At the time of his death, he was fifty-two years old.\n",
      "Publications \n",
      "\n",
      "Publications based upon his dissertation research began to appear in the early 1980s, and scholars of Mumbai's history awaited his study of the city and its working class with considerable anticipation.\n",
      "When The Origins of Industrial Capitalism (1994) first appeared in 1994, it was regarded with a sense of admiration, even awe, in some circles.\n",
      "The book was characterised by formidable research and represented a depth of local historical knowledge that went beyond anything that existed in the labour history of South Asia at the time.\n",
      "Origins challenged many existing interpretations; indeed it questioned the assumptions of what working class history should be.\n",
      "The study reached beyond the industrial workplace and trade unions into the larger informal economy of Mumbai, into the neighbourhoods where workers lived, and out to the rural areas, such as Ratnagiri and the Deccan, from which workers originated.\n",
      "The origins of capitalism, in Chandavarkar's view, lay not just in the initiatives of a few captains of industry but in a host of social forces that all played an active part in shaping the new economic structures of late colonial Mumbai.\n",
      "Origins was followed in 1998 by Imperial Power and Popular Politics.\n",
      "This was a diverse range of essays on industrial capitalism, workers' politics, the police in Mumbai, the plague, colonial discourse and the nature of the colonial state.\n",
      "Some of these essays were as rich empirically as Origins, while others were thought-provoking interpretive pieces.\n",
      "Contributions \n",
      "Together these two books and related articles set out coherent and fundamentally new ways of thinking about the history of western India and its economy.\n",
      "First, Chandavarkar's work offered new understandings of the processes of industrialisation and capitalist transformation.\n",
      "Rather than see the development of large-scale production as a simple matter of technological diffusion from Europe to India or as evidence of the triumph of entrepreneurial pioneers, Chandavarkar placed this process squarely within a historical context conditioned by imperialism, rural poverty, insecure markets, and the agency of workers.\n",
      "He argued that the formation of factories was often a risk-minimizing effort by almost marginal figures in the nineteenth century economy, men who were in positions of subordination to foreign businessmen in the export trades, who faced constant difficulties in mobilising capital, and who rushed around from one form of investment to another in hopes of making quick profits in this uncertain business climate.\n",
      "Chandavarkar especially highlighted the role of the workforce in conditioning the form of industrial capitalism in Mumbai.\n",
      "He saw industrialists and workers as participating in a common theatre of interaction; both sets of actors constrained the other's behaviour.\n",
      "Labour recruitment needs and workers' resistances consistently limited the power of capitalists to develop uniform policies that might have maximised profits; the strategies of industrialists served to promote divisions among their workers.\n",
      "A second set of contributions in these studies lay in their analysis of the social organisation of the working class.\n",
