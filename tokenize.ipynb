preacher, prophet and poet.\\nEarly life\\nShe was born in 1628 as Lilias Gillespie, one of eight children born to Lilias née Simson (d. 1627), the daughter of Patrick Simson, the minister of Stirling, and John Gillespie (d. 1627 or c.1647), the minister of Kirkcaldy.\\nHer father's date of death is uncertain, being either around the time of Skene's birth or just after her marriage in 1646.\\nHer brothers included the Church of Scotland ministers Patrick Gillespie, Principal of the University of Glasgow, and George Gillespie, a member of the Westminster Assembly.\\nMarriage and Conversion\\nOn 26 August 1646 at Kirkcaldy she married the Aberdeen merchant Alexander Skene (c1621–1694), a magistrate and the author of Memorialls for the Government of the Royall-Burghs in Scotland.\\nFrom 1649 to 1871 he held various offices in Aberdeen, including Treasurer of the Town Council, Dean of Guild, Baillie and a leading man in the church courts.\\nMoving to Aberdeen to live with her husband, between 1647 and 1669 the couple had ten children, their oldest surviving son being John Skene (c.1649–1690) who was to become Deputy Governor of West Jersey from 1684 to 1687.\\nSkene and her husband were avowed Covenanters (a 17th-century Scottish religious and political movement, who supported a Presbyterian Church of Scotland) who were admired for their deep faith at a time when their strict Presbyterianism was out of favour following the Restoration.\\nIn 1669 Skene suddenly converted to Quakerism,  with her husband joining her in 1672.\\nOf this time she wrote, 'It is very well known to all that lived in the place where I sojourned, I was none who conversed with them, I was never at one of their meetings, I never read one of their books', yet she experienced 'that thing the school-men call Immediat Objective Revelation'.\\nWhile the citizens of Aberdeen knew her as Lilias Gillespie, among the Quaker community she was known by her husband's surname.\\nThe Quaker community in Aberdeen was small but became increasingly influential, having Robert Barclay and George Keith in its congregation and Skene was the leading female figure in it, having a position equal to the men when dealing with disciplinary matters, while religious meetings were often held in the Skenes' home.\\nIn about 1678 Skene was involved in setting up the first Quaker school in Scotland.\\nHer leadership was much in evidence during the years of persecution of the Quaker community between 1676 and 1679 when every male Quaker in Aberdeen, almost 30 in number including her husband, oldest son and son-in-law, were imprisoned for months or years.\\nThe women of the community were not imprisoned and were free to meet and petition for the release of their menfolk.\\nHer searing letter of 31 March 1677 entitled 'Word of Warning to the Magistrates and Inhabitants of Aberdeen' publicly took to task the Magistrates, the ministers and the people of Aberdeen and was published in the local newspapers.\\nIn the letter she  mentioned her own preaching 'at severall seasons and in diverse maners I have witnessed' while also condemning the imprisoning of  'honest men that have families wives and children ... in those cold nasty stinking holes where ye have shutt them up, who have been as neatly handled and tenderly educated and as usefull in their generation as any amongst you'.\\nIt is likely that in the 1680s she helped her husband write his two manuscript accounts of the history of Quakerism in Aberdeen.\\nInfluence\\nIn 1676 Robert Barclay persuaded Skene to write to Elisabeth of the Palatinate (1618–1680), the Calvinist cousin of the Stuart kings, in an attempt to convert her.\\nThe Quakers hoped Elisabeth would intervene on their behalf with her royal relatives in Britain even though their attempt at evangelising her failed.\\nBarclay introduced Skene to Elisabeth as 'a woman of great experience and tenderness of heart who through great tribulations both of body and mind hath attained the earnest of the Kingdom [but whose] husband and son-in-law are now in Prison'.\\nSkene corresponded with the princess and her companion, Countess Anna Maria van Hoorn, and was invited to visit them at Herford Abbey in Westphalia, where Elisabeth was the Abbess.\\nSkene's letters have not survived but are referred to in correspondence between Barclay and the Princess.\\nThe biographer of George Keith says that Skene went with Keith, Barclay, George Fox and William Penn on their tour of the Netherlands and Germany during the summer of 1677.\\nSimilarly, Barclay wrote that Skene intended to go but Penn and Fox do not mention her in their writings about the trip, and in a letter written to Skene in 1678 Elisabeth seems to be implying that the two had not actually met, writing: 'I love your upright intention to travail (i.e.\\ntoil) in spirit for your friends, though unknown to you'.\\nDuring the summer of 1677 Skene was actually in London and also found time to visit the philosopher Anne Conway at her home, Ragley Hall in Worcestershire.\\nConway, a recent convert to Quakerism, was bedridden and Skene befriended her and the two began a correspondence with Skene organising from Aberdeen the hiring of Quaker servants for Conway's home.\\nLater life and writings\\nSkene's letters and poems are among the few writings still extant today of a 17th-century Scottish woman who was not an aristocrat.\\nHer only known publication during her lifetime (in which the author referred to her as Lillias Skein) was 'An Expostulatory Epistle, Directed to Robert Macquare' (1678) included in one of Robert Barclay's works in 1679.\\nMacquare (known today as Robert MacWard) was a Presbyterian dissenter whose hate-filled writings against the Quakers had previously persuaded her husband Alexander Skene to write and print a rebuttal.\\nLilias Skene's 'Epistle' against Macquare was balanced but to the point, commenting: 'O Robert!\\nthy hard speeches have manifested thy own sad acknowledgement to be very true, the Holy fire is gone out with thee indeed'.\\nThe 19th-century literary historian William Walker published selections from thirty-three lyric poems and three anagrams written by her between 1665 and 1697, 1,472 lines in total transcribed from an original manuscript in the private papers of a previous owner that are now lost, presumably accidentally burnt after the death of the owner.\\nLilias Skene's poetry and prose were heavy with mystical allusions and scriptural images of suffering and salvation.\\nThe Aberdeenshire poll-tax book for 1696 states that the now widowed Skene was living in modest circumstances in Aberdeen with her daughter Anna and two servants.\\nHere she died in June 1697 aged 68 and was buried beside her husband in an unmarked grave in the Quaker burial-ground at Kingswells.\\nToday there is a plaque dedicated to Lilias Skene on a wall near the entrance of the Crown Street Meeting house in Aberdeen in addition to an information board about her at the Tollhouse were the Quaker men were imprisoned during her lifetime.\\nReferences\",\n",

       " 'Rather than touring with the rest of the group, Eric \"Vietnam\" Sadler and Hank Shocklee would stay in the studio and work on material for the Nation of Millions album, so that the music was ready when Chuck D and Flavor Flav returned from tour.\\nWhen the group began planning the second album, the songs \"Bring the Noise\", \"Don\\'t Believe the Hype\", and \"Rebel Without a Pause\" had already been completed.\\nThe latter track was recorded during the group\\'s 1987 Def Jam tour, and the lyrics were written by Chuck D in one day spent secluded at his home.\\nInstead of looping the break from James Brown\\'s \"Funky Drummer\", a commonly used breakbeat in hip hop, \"Rebel Without a Pause\" had Flavor Flav play the beat on the drum machine continuously for the track\\'s duration of five minutes and two seconds.\\nChuck D later said of his contribution to the track, \"Flavor\\'s timing helped create almost like a band rhythm\".\\nTerminator X, the group\\'s DJ/turntablist, also incorporated a significant element to the track, the renowned transformer scratch, towards its end.\\nNamed for its similarity to the sound made by the Autobots in The Transformers, the scratch was developed by DJ Spinbad and popularized by DJ Jazzy Jeff and Cash Money, and Terminator X had honed his take on the scratch on tour.\\nThe group was satisfied with its sound after having removed the bass from his section of the track.\\nAccording to Chuck D, Hank Shocklee made the last call when songs were completed.\\n\"Hank would come up with the final mix because he was the sound master... Hank is the Phil Spector of hip-hop.\\nHe was way ahead of his time, because he dared to challenge the odds in sound.\"\\nThis was also one of the details which Chuck felt to be unique to the time and recording of the album.\\n\"Once hip-hop became corporate, they took the daredevil out of the artistry.\\nBut being a daredevil was what Hank brought to the table.\"\\nIt was decided amongst the group that the album should be exactly one hour long, thirty minutes on each side.\\nAt the time, audio cassettes were more popular than CDs and the group did not want listeners having to hear dead air for a long time after one-half of the album was finished.\\nThe two sides of the album were originally the other way around, the album beginning with \"Show Em Whatcha Got\" which leads into \"She Watch Channel Zero?!\".\\nThis instead became the start of side two or the \"Black Side\".\\nHank Shocklee decided to flip the sides just before the mastering of the album and start the record with Dave Pearce introducing the group during their first tour of England.\\nMusic and lyrics',\n",
       " 'Under Hank Shocklee\\'s direction, the Bomb Squad, the group\\'s production team, began to develop a dense and chaotic production style that relied on found sounds and avant-garde noise as much as it did on old-school funk.\\nAlong with a varied selection of sampled elements, the tracks feature a greater tempo than those of the group\\'s contemporaries.\\nMusic critic Robert Christgau noted these elements and wrote that the Bomb Squad \"juice post-Coleman/Coltrane ear-wrench with the kind of furious momentum harmolodic funk has never dared: the shit never stops abrading and exploding\".\\nAs with the group\\'s live performances, Flavor Flav supported Chuck D\\'s politically charged lyrics with \"hype man\" vocals and surrealistic lyrics on the album.\\nOn the album\\'s content, music journalist Peter Shapiro wrote \"Droning feedback, occasional shards of rock guitar, and James Brown horn samples distorted into discordant shrieks back the political rhetoric of lead rapper Chuck D and the surreality of Flavor Flav\".\\nEthnomathematics author Ron Eglash interpreted the album\\'s style and production to be \"massively interconnected political and sonic content\", writing that \"[the Bomb Squad] navigated the ambiguity between the philosophies of sound and voice.\\nPublic Enemy\\'s sound demonstrated an integration of lyrical content, vocal tone, sample density and layering, scratch deconstruction, and sheer velocity that rap music has never been able to recapture, and that hip-hop DJs and producers are still mining for gems\".\\nIn an interview with the New York Daily News, Shocklee noted that the album\\'s dynamic sound was inspired by Chuck D\\'s rapping prowess, stating \"Chuck\\'s a powerful rapper.\\nWe wanted to make something that could sonically stand up to him\".\\nOf his own contributions to its production, Shocklee cited himself as being the arranger and noted that he had \"no interest in linear songs\".\\nWhen using records for sampling, Shocklee stated that he\\'d sometimes put them on the ground and stomp on them if they sounded too \"clean.\"\\nHank referred to Chuck D as being the person who would find all the vocal samples, Eric Sadler as \"the one with the musical talent,\" and noted that his brother, Keith Shocklee, \"knew a lot of the breakbeats and was the sound-effects master.\"\\nShocklee\\'s sentiments were reinforced by Chuck D while explaining the group\\'s working methods during production.\\n\"Eric was the musician, Hank was the antimusician.\\nEric did a lot of the [drum] programming, [Hank\\'s brother] Keith was the guy who would bring in the feel.\"\\nFor his contributions to the production side, Chuck stated that he \"would scour for vocal samples all over the Earth.\\nI would name a song, tag it, and get the vocal samples.\"\\nChuck D also noted the productiveness of Sadler and Shocklee\\'s differing approaches to the creative process.\\n\"The friction between Hank and Eric worked very well.\\nHank would put a twist on Eric\\'s musicianship and Eric\\'s musicianship would put a twist on Hank.\"\\nSome production mistakes were kept for the album.\\nThe breakdown in \"Bring the Noise\" in which the kick-drum sample from James Brown\\'s \"Funky Drummer\" plays solo was a mistake.\\nApparently, the wrong sequence came up in the SP1200 sampler and Shocklee decided not only to keep it but to have Chuck rewrite his rhyme to fit the pattern.\\nThe album itself was mixed with no automation, instead of being recorded on analog tape and later painstakingly mixed by hand.\\nThis is a significant fact due to its nature as being one of the most intricate albums of digitally sampled music.\\nAsked years later if replicating the number of samples used on the album would be possible [due to increased clearance costs for copyrighted material], Hank Shocklee said while possible, it would be far more expensive.\\nSongs',\n",
       " 'Throughout the album, Chuck D delivers narratives that are characterized by black nationalist rhetoric and regard topics such as self-empowerment for African Americans, critiques of white supremacy, and challenges to exploitation in the music industry.\\n\"Caught, Can We Get a Witness?\"\\ndirectly addresses the issue of sampling in hip hop and copyright violation from a perspective that supports the practice and claims entitlement due to \"black ownership of the sounds in the first place\".\\n\"Rebel Without a Pause\" exemplifies the faster tempo that Public Enemy intended for the album, while incorporating a heavy beat and samples of screeching horns, the latter taken from the J.B.\\'s\\' \"The Grunt\" (1970).\\nAccording to Ron Eglash, such effects of sampling exemplify the \"sense of urgency\" given to the messages of the album\\'s tracks, \"to heighten the tension of the mix\", while Chuck D\\'s message is \"one of total resistance that was readily accessible through [...] the confrontational sounds of bass, groove, and noise.\"\\nLyrically, it eschews the traditional verse/chorus—verse/chorus song structure, with 12 bars of Chuck D\\'s aggressive rapping, punctuated by Flavor Flav\\'s stream of consciousness ad-libs.\\nPublic Enemy-biographer Russell Myrie writes of the track\\'s significance, \"It matched \\'I Know You Got Soul\\' in terms of its innovation and its breathtaking quality.\\nIt increased the tempo for Public Enemy, something they would do repeatedly during their forthcoming masterpiece [...] The faster tempo was important as it would heighten energy levels at their shows.\\nMost important of all, it sounded fresh.\\nIt was some next level hip-hop.\\nChuck and Hank rightly felt it could stand alongside the best rap records of the time.\"\\nSome of the song titles make reference to other works from popular culture.\\nThe title of the song \"Party for Your Right to Fight\" is a rearrangement of the Beastie Boys\\' 1987 hit single \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\"\\nThe vocal sample of hip hop DJ Mr. Magic stating that his show would play \"no more music by the suckers\" was used on the song \"Cold Lampin\\' with Flavor\" after having been recorded from Magic\\'s radio show by Flavor Flav.\\nMagic had dissed the group with the line when he mistakenly embroiled them in the WBAU-WBLS radio war.\\nChuck D has said that \"Party for Your Right to Fight\", the album\\'s closing track, is dedicated to the Black Panther Party.\\nRelease and reception \\nThe album was released on June 28, 1988 and in its first month of release, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back sold 500,000 copies without significant promotional efforts by its distributing label Columbia Records.\\nIt peaked at number 42 on the U.S.\\nBillboard Top Pop Albums chart and at number one on the Top Black Albums chart.\\nIt spent 49 weeks on the Billboard Top Pop Albums.\\nOn August 22, 1989, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of at least one million copies in the United States.\\nSince 1991, when the tracking system Nielsen SoundScan began tracking domestic sales data, the album has sold 722,000 additional copies .\\nIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back received positive reviews from contemporary critics.\\nIn his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described the album as a \"Molotov cocktail of nuclear scratching, gnarly minimalist electronics and revolution rhyme\" and complimented its \"abrupt sequencing and violent sonic compression of rapid-fire samples, slamming-jail-door percussion, DJ Terminator X\\'s tornado turntable work and Chuck D\\'s outraged oratory\".\\nLos Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn said that the album incorporates some of the dynamics of early rap records such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five\\'s \"The Message\" (1982) and Run–D.M.C.\\n\\'s \"Sucker M.C.\\n\\'s\" (1983) with the \"radical, socially conscious tradition of groups like the Last Poets\".\\nHilburn commended Chuck D for his rapping on It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, writing that he \"isn\\'t afraid of being labeled an extremist, and it\\'s that fearless bite—or game plan—that helps infuse his black-consciousness raps with the anger and assault of punk pioneers like the Sex Pistols and Clash\".\\nWriting for NME, critic James Brown said that \"Nation of Millions... is impressive because it moves, it uses and it\\'s a music—not the acetate-thin barrage of whingeing and boasting that so often passes for rap\", while in Q, David Sinclair called it \"an unimaginably urgent album seething with vengeful rage and booby trapped with incendiary musical devices\".\\nJon Pareles of The New York Times praised the album for its production and compared its symbolic value to hip hop music at the time, stating:',\n",
       " 'Despite writing that it \"sounds powerful, fresh and galvanizing\", Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post found its lyrical content inconsistent, stating \"Aurally, Nation of Millions is intoxicating; Hank Shocklee and Carl Ryder\\'s bold production will likely prove among the most distinctive of the year, not just in rap but in any pop genre.\\nFor their work to pack the political wallop they crave, however, the members of Public Enemy need to think for themselves, not just attach themselves to the thought of whichever black nationalist is currently drawing big crowds\".\\nThe Los Angeles Daily News gave the album a \"B\" and compared its musical \"rage\" to that of rapper Schoolly D\\'s Smoke Some Kill (1988).\\nIn its year-end list of 1988\\'s best albums, Q called It Takes a Nation \"a blistering collage of beat box [sic], rock guitar, police-radio chatter and high-velocity rapping.\"\\nIt was voted number one in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics\\' poll, as well as number three on poll creator Robert Christgau\\'s list.\\nIn an article for the newspaper, Christgau called it \"the bravest and most righteous experimental pop of the decade—no matter how the music looks written down (ha ha), Hank Shocklee and Terminator X have translated Blood Ulmer\\'s harmolodic visions into a street fact that\\'s no less edutaining (if different) in the dwellings of monkey spawn and brothers alike (and different)\".\\nLegacy and influence',\n",
       " 'It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back has been cited by critics and publications as one of the greatest and most influential recordings of all time.\\nUpon the album\\'s remastered

[than Yo!\\nBum Rush the Show].\\nOr better.\"\\nNME dubbed it \"the greatest hip-hop album ever\" at the time, stating \"this wasn\\'t merely a sonic triumph.\\nThis was also where Chuck wrote a fistful of lyrics that promoted him to the position of foremost commentator/documentor of life in the underbelly of the USA\".\\nReaders of Hip Hop Connection voted it the best album of all-time, prompting the magazine to comment, \"Even \\'Rebel Without a Pause\\', a definite contender for best rap single ever released, failed to put the other 12 [sic] tracks to shame, such was the high standard throughout.\"\\nHHC readers again voted it the best of all-time in 2000, as did Flavor Flav in his accompanying top ten.\\n\"This is really hard,\" he said, \"because I\\'m in love with every piece of work that\\'s ever been recorded.\\nI would never say someone else\\'s project is better than anyone else\\'s.\"\\nMojo stated upon the album\\'s 2000 European reissue, \"Responsible for the angriest polemic since The Last Poets....[they] revolutionized the music, using up to 80 backing tracks in the sonic assault....to these ears PE sound like the greatest rock\\'n\\'roll band in history\".\\nIn 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 48 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, making it the highest-ranked of the 27 hip hop albums included on the list, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.\\nTime magazine hailed it as one of the 100 greatest albums of all time in 2006.\\nKurt Cobain, the lead guitarist and singer of rock band Nirvana, listed the album as one of his top 50 favorite albums in his Journals.\\nIn 2006, Q placed the album at number seven on its list of \"40 Best Albums of the \\'80s\".\\nAs of July 2014, It Takes a Nation of Millions is ranked as the top album of 1988 and the eighteenth greatest album of all time at Acclaimed Music.\\nIn 2012, Slant Magazine listed the album at #3 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\" behind Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller and Prince and the Revolution\\'s Purple Rain.\\nThe album ranks Number 2 on the list of best records of the 20th century of German music magazine Spex.\\nIn his 2004 book Appropriating Technology: Vernacular Science and Social Power, Ron Eglash commented that a sonically and politically charged album such as Nation \"can be considered a monument to the synthesis of sound and politics\".\\nIn 2005, New York University\\'s Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music hosted a two-day retrospective called \"The Making of It Takes a Nation of Millions.\"\\nIt featured a producers\\' panel that reunited Hank Shocklee, captain of the Bomb Squad, with the Chairmen of the Boards from Greene St. Recording.\\nWhen asked in 2008 if the album would still be considered as radical if it were released two decades later, Chuck D said he felt it would \"simply because it\\'s faster than anything on the radio right now.\\nAnd yeah, it\\'s radical politically... because it\\'s not really being said a lot.\\nYou want it to not be radical, but it is because it\\'s totally different from Soulja Boy.\"\\nAmerican rapper Ice Cube said in 2005 that the album \"messes with your brain even to this day.\"\\nThe album\\'s revolutionary attitudes also influenced musician and activist Kathleen Hanna of the seminal riot grrrl band Bikini Kill.\\nShe described it as her go-to album while touring, stating: \"I was like, \\'Man, some of these rappers are bragging and boasting, and I wanna brag and boast!\\'\\nLike, why do I feel like I have to try to write the song I\\'m supposed to write, and not the song I wanna write?\"\\nPublic Enemy performed the album in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow\\'s Parties-curated Don\\'t Look Back series.\\n\"I didn\\'t think it would work,\" Chuck D admitted of the full-length performance.\\n\"But it ended up being something that worked tremendously well.\\nNow we have a problem to get away from it.\\nIt amazed me that a lot of people who have gravitated to the album weren\\'t even born when it was recorded.\\nBut it\\'s YouTube and iLike and MySpace and file sharing which highlighted the existence of it.\\nSo I can\\'t shoot down file sharing, as it\\'s benefited us tremendously.\"\\nMusic from the album has been sampled over the years, including (though not limited

       " \"In June 2011, the 100th anniversary of Kuo's graduation from the University of Wooster, and ninety years after Kuo was appointed as President of National Southeastern University, a conference examining Kuo's contribution to higher education in China was held in Nanjing at Southeast University, the site of former Southeastern University which Kuo had helped found.\\nScholars from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, and the United States were represented, and the participants presented papers dealing with Kuo's educational thought, his ideas on structuring higher education in China, and his impact on relations between East and West.\\nOn October 25, 2014, a symposium was held at Columbia University Teachers College dealing with Kuo's contributions to higher education in China and to Sino-Cultural institutions and affairs in the United States.\\nScholars from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China and the United States contributed papers and participated in discussions on Kuo's career and its significance.\\nIn March, 2016, the book Kuo Ping Wen: Scholar, Reformer, Statesman, a collection of essays on Kuo as educator, statesman, and cultural ambassador, edited by Ryan Allen and Ji Liu, was published by Long River Press, and in October, 2016 a book-signing symposium was held at the C.V. Starr East Asian Library at Columbia University.\\nSince his academic background was shaped at liberal arts institutions, Kuo believed that a well-rounded education in both the sciences and the humanities was essential.\\nMoreover, since his undergraduate experience at the University of Wooster was co-educational, he was a strong supporter of women's education in China.\\nIt was at the University of Wooster that Kuo changed his plan to study law and focused instead on issues of educational reform, which became the basis for his career once he returned to China.\\nHis educational philosophy embraced a strategy based on Four Balances: the balance between well-rounded education and specialized education, the balance between humanistic education and scientific education, the balance between investment in teaching faculty and investment in teaching facilities, and the balance between national and international learning.\\nKuo felt that China could learn much from the study of Western accomplishments in science, just as the West could learn much from China about the philosophy of life, and he was a strong supporter of the expansion of Chinese studies at American colleges and universities.\\nIn furthering interactions between East and West through education, Kuo Ping-wen contributed to building the Sino-American relationship that flourishes today.\\nReferences\",\n",

       " 'Blacksmiths work by heating pieces of wrought iron or steel until the metal becomes soft enough for shaping with hand tools, such as a hammer, an anvil and a chisel.\\nHeating generally takes place in a forge fueled by propane, natural gas, coal, charcoal, coke, or oil.\\nSome modern blacksmiths may also employ an oxyacetylene or similar blowtorch for more localized heating.\\nInduction heating methods are gaining popularity among modern blacksmiths.\\nColor is important for indicating the temperature and workability of the metal.\\nAs iron heats to higher temperatures, it first glows red, then orange, yellow, and finally white.\\nThe ideal heat for most forging is the bright yellow-orange color that indicates forging heat.\\nBecause they must be able to see the glowing color of the metal, some blacksmiths work in dim, low-light conditions, but most work in well-lit conditions.\\nThe key is to have consistent lighting, but not too bright.\\nDirect sunlight obscures the colors.\\nThe techniques of smithing can be roughly divided into forging (sometimes called \"sculpting\"), welding, heat-treating, and finishing.\\nForging\\n \\nForging—the process smiths use to shape metal by hammering—differs from machining in that forging does not remove material.\\nInstead, the smith hammers the iron into shape.\\nEven punching and cutting operations (except when trimming waste) by smiths usually re-arrange metal around the hole, rather than drilling it out as swarf.\\nForging uses seven basic operations or techniques:',\n",

       " 'These operations generally require at least a hammer and anvil, but smiths also use other tools and techniques to accommodate odd-sized or repetitive jobs.\\nDrawing',\n",
       " 'Drawing lengthens the metal by reducing one or both of the other two dimensions.\\nAs the depth is reduced, or the width narrowed, the piece is lengthened or \"drawn out.\"\\nAs an example of drawing, a smith making a chisel might flatten a square bar of steel, lengthening the metal, reducing its depth but keeping its width consistent.\\nDrawing does not have to be uniform.\\nA taper can result as in making a wedge or a woodworking chisel blade.\\nIf tapered in two dimensions, a point results.\\nDrawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods.\\nTwo typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn, and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer.\\nAnother method for drawing is to use a tool called a fuller, or the peen of the hammer, to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal.\\n(The technique is called fullering from the tool.)\\nFullering consists of hammering a series of indentations with corresponding ridges, perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn.\\nThe resulting effect looks somewhat like waves along the top of the piece.\\nThen the smith turns the hammer over to use the flat face to hammer the tops of the ridges down level with the bottoms of the indentations.\\nThis forces the metal to grow in length (and width if left unchecked) much faster than just hammering with the flat face of the hammer.\\nBending',\n",
       " 'Heating iron to a \"forging heat\" allows bending as if it were a soft, ductile metal, like copper or silver.\\nBending can be done with the hammer over the horn or edge of the anvil or by inserting a bending fork into the hardy hole (the square hole in the top of the anvil), placing the work piece between the tines of the fork, and bending the material to the desired angle.\\nBends can be dressed and tightened, or widened, by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil.\\nSome metals are \"hot short\", meaning they lose their tensile strength when heated.\\nThey become like Plasticine: although they may still be manipulated by squeezing, an attempt to stretch them, even by bending or twisting, is likely to have them crack and break apart.\\nThis is a problem for some blade-making steels, which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that would cause failure in the future.\\nThough rarely hand-worked, titanium is notably hot short.\\nEven such common smithing processes as decoratively twisting a bar are impossible with it.\\nUpsetting \\nUpsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other.\\nOne form is to heat the end of a rod and then hammer on it as one would drive a nail: the rod gets shorter, and the hot part widens.\\nAn alternative to hammering on the hot end is to place the hot end on the anvil and hammer on the cold end.\\nPunching \\nPunching may be done to create a decorative pattern, or to make a hole.\\nFor example, in preparation for making a hammerhead, a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle.\\nPunching is not limited to depressions and holes.\\nIt also includes cutting, slitting, and drifting—all done with a chisel.\\nCombining processes \\nThe five basic forging processes are often combined to produce and refine the shapes necessary for finished products.\\nFor example, to fashion a cross-peen hammer head, a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face: the handle hole would be punched and drifted (widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it), the head would be cut (punched, but with a wedge), the peen would be drawn to a wedge, and the face would be dressed by upsetting.\\nAs with making a chisel, since it is lengthened by drawing it would also tend to spread in width.\\nA smith would therefore frequently turn the chisel-to-be on its side and hammer it back down—upsetting it—to check the spread and keep the metal at the correct width.\\nOr, if a smith needed to put a 90-degree bend in a bar and wanted a sharp corner on the outside of the bend, they would begin by hammering an unsupported end to make the curved bend.\\nThen, to \"fatten up\" the outside radius of the bend, one or both arms of the bend would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve.\\nSo they would hammer the ends of the stock down into the bend, \\'upsetting\\' it at the point of the bend.\\nThey would then dress the bend by drawing the sides of the bend to keep the correct thickness.\\nThe hammering would continue—upsetting and then drawing—until the curve had been properly shaped.\\nIn the primary operation was the bend, but the drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape.\\nWelding \\nWelding is the joining of the same or similar kind of metal.\\nA modern blacksmith has a range of options and tools to accomplish this.\\nThe basic types of welding commonly employed in a modern workshop include traditional forge welding as well as modern methods, including oxyacetylene and arc welding.\\nIn forge welding, the pieces to join are heated to what is generally referred to as welding heat.\\nFor mild steel most smiths judge this temperature by color: the metal glows an intense yellow or white.\\nAt this temperature the steel is near molten.\\nAny foreign material in the weld, such as the oxides or \"scale\" that typically form in the fire, can weaken it and cause it to fail.\\nThus the mating surfaces to be joined must be kept clean.\\nTo this end a smith makes sure the fire is a reducing fire: a fire where, at the heart, there is a great deal of heat and very little oxygen.\\nThe smith also carefully shapes mating faces so that as they come together foreign material squeezes out as the metal is joined.\\nTo clean the faces, protect them from oxidation, and provide a medium to carry foreign material out of the weld, the smith sometimes uses flux—typically powdered borax, silica sand, or both.\\nThe smith first cleans parts to be joined with a wire brush, then puts them in the fire to heat.\\nWith a mix of drawing and upsetting the smith shapes the faces so that when finally brought together, the center of the weld connects first and the connection spreads outward under the hammer blows, pushing out the flux (if used) and foreign material.\\nThe dressed metal goes back in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed.\\nFlux is sometimes applied, which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging, and it is returned to the fire.\\nThe smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal.\\nThere is some challenge to this because, to see the color of the metal, the smith must remove it from the fire—exposing it to air, which can rapidly oxidize it.\\nSo the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire, prodding lightly at the mating faces.\\nWhen the end of the wire sticks on to the metal, it is at the right temperature (a small weld forms where the wire touches the mating face, so it sticks).\\nThe smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface.\\n(Note that smiths don\\'t always use flux, especially in the UK.)\\nNow the smith moves with rapid purpose, quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together.\\nA few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux—and finally, the smith returns the work to the fire.\\nThe weld begins with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to \"set\" the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.\\nFinishing',\n",
       " 'Depending on the intended use of the piece, a blacksmith may finish it in a number of ways:',\n",
       " \"A simple jig (a tool) that the smith might only use a few times in the shop may get the minimum of finishing—a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush.\\nFiles bring a piece to final shape, removing burrs and sharp edges, and smoothing the surface.\\nHeat treatment and case-hardening achieve the desired hardness.\\nThe wire brush—as a hand tool or power tool—can further smooth, brighten, and polish surfaces.\\nGrinding stones, abrasive paper, and emery wheels can further shape, smooth, and polish the surface.\\nA range of treatments and finishes can inhibit oxidation and enhance or change the appearance of the piece.\\nAn experienced smith selects the finish based on the metal and on the intended use of the item.\\nFinishes include (among others): paint, varnish, bluing, browning, oil, and wax.\\nBlacksmith's striker\",\n",
       " 'A blacksmith\\'s striker is an assistant (frequently an apprentice) whose job is to swing a large sledgehammer in heavy forging operations, as directed by the blacksmith.\\nIn practice, the blacksmith holds the hot iron at the anvil (with tongs) in one hand, and indicates where to strike the iron by tapping it with a small hammer in the other hand.\\nThe striker then delivers a heavy blow to the indicated spot with a sledgehammer.\\nDuring the 20th century and into the 21st century, this role has become increasingly unnecessary and automated through the use of trip hammers or reciprocating power hammers.\\nBlacksmith\\'s materials \\nWhen iron ore is smelted into usable metal, a certain amount of carbon is usually alloyed with the iron.\\n(Charcoal is almost pure carbon.)\\nThe amount of carbon significantly affects the properties of the metal.\\nIf the carbon content is over 2%, the metal is called cast iron, because it has a relatively low melting point and is easily cast.\\nIt is quite brittle, however, and cannot be forged so therefore not used for blacksmithing.\\nIf the carbon content is between 0.25% and 2%, the resulting metal is tool steel, which can be heat treated as discussed above.\\nWhen the carbon content is below 0.25%, the metal is either \"wrought iron (wrought iron is not smelted and cannot come from this process) \" or \"mild steel.\"\\nThe terms are never interchangeable.\\nIn preindustrial times, the material of choice for blacksmiths was wrought iron.\\nThis iron had a very low carbon content, and also included up to 5% of glassy iron silicate slag in the form of numerous very fine stringers.\\nThis slag content made the iron very tough, gave it considerable resistance to rusting, and allowed it to be more easily \"forge welded,\" a process in which the blacksmith permanently joins two pieces of iron, or a piece of iron and a piece of steel, by heating them nearly to a white heat and hammering them together.\\nForge welding is more difficult with modern mild steel, because it welds in a narrower temperature band.\\nThe fibrous nature of wrought iron required knowledge and skill to properly form any tool which would be subject to stress.\\nModern steel is produced using either the blast furnace or arc furnaces.\\nWrought iron was produced by a labor-intensive process called puddling, so this material is now a difficult-to-find specialty product.\\nModern blacksmiths generally substitute mild steel for making objects traditionally of wrought iron.\\nSometimes they use electrolytic-process pure iron.\\nOther metals \\nMany blacksmiths also incorporate materials such as bronze, copper, or brass in artistic products.\\nAluminum and titanium may also be forged by the blacksmith\\'s process.\\nBronze is an alloy of copper and tin, while brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.\\nEach material responds differently under the hammer and must be separately studied by the blacksmith.\\nTerminology',\n",
       " 'Iron is a naturally occurring metallic element.\\nIt is almost never found in its native form (pure iron) in nature.\\nIt is usually found as an oxide or sulfide, with many other impurity elements mixed in.\\nWrought iron is the purest form of iron generally encountered or produced in quantity.\\nIt may contain as little as 0.04% carbon (by weight).\\nFrom its traditional method of manufacture, wrought iron has a fibrous internal texture.\\nQuality wrought-iron blacksmithing takes the direction of these fibers into account during forging, since the strength of the material is stronger in line with the grain than across the grain.\\nMost of the remaining impurities from the initial smelting become concentrated in silicate slag trapped between the iron fibers.\\nThis slag produces a lucky side effect during forge-welding.\\nWhen the silicate melts, it makes wrought iron self-fluxing.\\nThe slag becomes a liquid glass that covers the exposed surfaces of the wrought iron, preventing oxidation which would otherwise interfere with the successful welding process.\\nSteel is an alloy of iron and between 0.3% and 1.7% carbon by weight.\\nThe presence of carbon allows steel to assume one of several different crystalline configurations.\\nMacroscopically, this is seen as the ability to \"turn the hardness of a piece of steel on and off\" through various processes of heat-treatment.\\nIf the concentration of carbon is held constant, this is a reversible process.\\nSteel with a higher carbon percentage may be brought to a higher state of maximum hardness.\\nCast iron is iron that contains between 2.0% to 6% carbon by weight.\\nThere is so much carbon present that the hardness cannot be switched off.\\nHence, cast iron is a brittle metal, which can break like glass.\\nCast iron cannot be forged without special heat treatment to convert it to malleable iron.\\nSteel with less than 0.6% carbon content cannot be hardened enough by simple heat-treatment to make useful hardened-steel tools.\\nHence, in what follows, wrought-iron, low-carbon-steel, and other soft unhardenable iron varieties are referred to indiscriminately as just iron.\\nHistory, prehistory, religion, and mythology',\n",
       " 'Mythology',\n",
       " 'In Hindu mythology, Tvastar also known as Vishvakarma is the blacksmith of the devas.\\nThe earliest references of Tvastar can be found in the Rigveda.\\nHephaestus (Latin: Vulcan) was the blacksmith of the gods in Greek and Roman mythology.\\nA supremely skilled artisan whose forge was a volcano, he constructed most of the weapons of the gods, as well as beautiful assistants for his smithy and a metal fishing-net of astonishing intricacy.\\nHe was the god of metalworking, fire, and craftsmen.\\nIn Celtic mythology, the role of Smith is held by eponymous (their names do mean \\'smith\\') characters : Goibhniu  (Irish myths of the Tuatha Dé Danann cycle) or Gofannon (Welsh myths/ the Mabinogion).\\nBrigid or Brigit, an Irish goddess, is sometimes described as the patroness of blacksmiths.\\nIn the Nart mythology of the Caucasus the hero known to the Ossetians as Kurdalægon and the Circassians as Tlepsh is a blacksmith and skilled craftsman whose exploits exhibit shamanic features, sometimes bearing comparison to those of the Scandinavian deity Odin.\\nOne of his greatest feats is acting as a type of male midwife to the hero Xamyc, who has been made the carrier of the embryo of his son Batraz by his dying wife the water-sprite Lady Isp, who spits it between his shoulder blades, where it forms a womb-like cyst.\\nKurdalaegon prepares a type of tower or scaffold above a quenching bath for Xamyc, and, when the time is right, lances the cyst to liberate the infant hero Batraz as a newborn babe of white-hot steel, whom Kurdalægon then quenches like a newly forged sword.\\nThe Anglo-Saxon Wayland Smith, known in Old Norse as Völundr, is a heroic blacksmith in Germanic mythology.\\nThe Poetic Edda states that he forged beautiful gold rings set with wonderful gems.\\nHe was captured by king Níðuðr, who cruelly hamstrung him and imprisoned him on an island.\\nVölundr eventually had his revenge by killing Níðuðr\\'s sons and fashioning goblets from their skulls, jewels from their eyes and a brooch from their teeth.\\nHe then raped the king\\'s daughter, after drugging her with strong beer, and escaped, laughing, on wings of his own making, boasting that he had fathered a child upon her.\\nSeppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer, blacksmith and inventor in the Kalevala, is an archetypal artificer from Finnish mythology.\\nTubal-Cain is mentioned in the book of Genesis of the Torah as the original smith.\\nOgun, the god of blacksmiths, warriors, hunters and others who work with iron is one of the pantheon of Orisha traditionally worshipped by the Yoruba people of Nigeria.\\nBefore the Iron Age \\nGold, silver, and copper all occur in nature in their native states, as reasonably pure metals humans probably worked these metals first.\\nThese metals are all quite malleable, and humans\\' initial development of hammering techniques was undoubtedly applied to these metals.\\nDuring the Chalcolithic era and the Bronze Age, humans in the Mideast learned how to smelt, melt, cast, rivet, and (to a limited extent) forge copper and bronze.\\nBronze is an alloy of copper and approximately 10% to 20% Tin.\\nBronze is superior to just copper, by being harder, being more resistant to corrosion, and by having a lower melting point (thereby requiring less fuel to melt and cast).\\nMuch of the copper used by the Mediterranean World came from the island of Cyprus.\\nMost of the tin came from the Cornwall region of the island of Great Britain, transported by sea-borne Phoenician and Greek traders.\\nCopper and bronze cannot be hardened by heat-treatment, they can only be hardened by cold working.\\nTo accomplish this, a piece of bronze is lightly hammered for a long period of time.\\nThe localized stress-cycling causes work hardening by changing the size and shape of the metal\\'s crystals.\\nThe hardened bronze can then be ground to sharpen it to make edged tools.\\nClocksmiths as recently as the 19th century used work hardening techniques to harden the teeth of brass gears and ratchets.\\nTapping on just the teeth produced harder teeth, with superior wear-resistance.\\nBy contrast, the rest of the gear was left in a softer and tougher state, more capable of resisting cracking.\\nBronze is sufficiently corrosion-resistant that artifacts of bronze may last thousands of years relatively unscathed.\\nAccordingly, museums frequently preserve more examples of Bronze Age metal-work than examples of artifacts from the much younger Iron Age.\\nBuried iron artifacts may completely rust away in less than 100 years.\\nExamples of ancient iron work still extant are very much the exception to the norm.\\nIron Age \\nConcurrent with the advent of alphabetic characters in the Iron Age, humans became aware of the metal iron.\\nHowever, in earlier ages, iron\\'s qualities, in contrast to those of bronze, were not generally understood.\\nIron artifacts, composed of meteoric iron, have the chemical composition containing up to 40% nickel.\\nAs this source of this iron is extremely rare and fortuitous, little development of smithing skills peculiar to iron can be assumed to have occurred.\\nThat we still possess any such artifacts of meteoric iron may be ascribed to the vagaries of climate, and the increased corrosion-resistance conferred on iron by the presence of nickel.\\nDuring the (north) Polar Exploration of the early 20th century, Inughuit, northern Greenlandic Inuit, were found to be making iron knives from two particularly large nickel-iron meteors.\\nOne of these meteors was taken to Washington, D.C., where it was remitted to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution.\\nThe Hittites of Anatolia first discovered or developed the smelting of iron ores around 1500 BC.\\nThey seem to have maintained a near monopoly on the knowledge of iron production for several hundred years, but when their empire collapsed during the Eastern Mediterranean upheavals around 1200 BC, the knowledge seems to have escaped in all directions.\\nIn the Iliad of Homer (describing the Trojan War and Bronze Age Greek and Trojan warriors), most of the armor and weapons (swords and spears) are stated to have been of bronze.\\nIron is not unknown, however, as arrowheads are described as iron, and a \"ball of iron\" is listed as a prize awarded for winning a competition.\\nThe events described probably occurred around 1200 BC, but Homer is thought to have composed this epic poem around 700 BC; so exactitude must remain suspect.\\nWhen historical records resume after the 1200 BC upheavals and the ensuing Greek Dark Age, iron work (and presumably blacksmiths) seem to have sprung like Athena, fully-grown from the head of Zeus.\\nVery few artifacts remain, due to loss from corrosion, and re-use of iron as a valuable commodity.\\nWhat information exists indicates that all of the basic operations of blacksmithing were in use as soon as the Iron Age reached a particular locality.\\nThe scarcity of records and artifacts, and the rapidity of the switch from Bronze Age to Iron Age, is a reason to use evidence of bronze smithing to infer about the early development of blacksmithing.\\nIt is uncertain when Iron weapons replaced Bronze weapons because the earliest Iron swords did not significantly improve on the qualities of existing bronze artifacts.\\nUnalloyed iron is soft, does not hold an edge as well as a properly constructed bronze blade and needs more maintenance.\\nIron ores are more widely available than the necessary materials to create bronze however, which made iron weapons more economical than comparable bronze weapons.\\nSmall amounts of steel are often formed during several of the earliest refining practices, and when the properties of this alloy were discovered and exploited, steel edged weapons greatly outclassed bronze.\\nIron is different from most other materials (including bronze), in that it does not immediately go from a solid to a liquid at its melting point.\\nH2O is a solid (ice) at −1 C (31 F), and a liquid (water) at +1 C (33 F).\\nIron, by contrast, is definitely a solid at , but over the next  it becomes increasingly plastic and more \"taffy-like\" as its temperature increases.\\nThis extreme temperature range of variable solidity is the fundamental material property upon which blacksmithing practice depends.\\nAnother major difference between bronze and iron fabrication techniques is that bronze can be melted.\\nThe melting point of iron is much higher than that of bronze.\\nIn the western (Europe & the Mideast) tradition, the technology to make fires hot enough to melt iron did not arise until the 16th century, when smelting operations grew large enough to require overly large bellows.\\nThese produced blast-furnace temperatures high enough to melt partially refined ores, resulting in cast iron.\\nThus cast iron frying pans and cookware did not become possible in Europe until 3000 years after the introduction of iron smelting.\\nChina, in a separate developmental tradition, was producing cast iron at least 1000 years before this.\\nAlthough iron is quite abundant, good quality steel remained rare and expensive until the industrial developments of Bessemer process et al.\\nin the 1850s.\\nClose examination of blacksmith-made antique tools clearly shows where small pieces of steel were forge-welded into iron to provide the hardened steel cutting edges of tools (notably in axes, adzes, chisels, etc.).\\nThe re-use of quality steel is another reason for the lack of artifacts.\\nThe Romans (who ensured that their own weapons were made with good steel) noted (in the 4th century BC) that the Celts of the Po River Valley had iron, but not good steel.\\nThe Romans record that during battle, their Celtic opponents could only swing their swords two or three times before having to step on their swords to straighten them.\\nOn the Indian subcontinent, Wootz steel was, and continues to be, produced in small quantities.\\nIn southern Asia and western Africa, blacksmiths form endogenous castes that sometimes speak distinct languages.\\nMedieval period',\n",
       " 'In the medieval period, blacksmithing was considered part of the set of seven mechanical arts.\\nPrior to the industrial revolution, a \"village smithy\" was a staple of every town.\\nFactories and mass-production reduced the demand for blacksmith-made tools and hardware.\\nBlacksmiths typically worked in small shops, often in the center of a village or town.\\nTheir shops were typically equipped with a forge, an anvil, and a variety of other tools.\\nThe work of a medieval blacksmith was physically demanding and often dangerous.\\nBlacksmiths had to be able to lift and move heavy pieces of metal, and they had to be careful not to burn themselves on the hot forge.\\nDespite the challenges, blacksmithing was a respected trade in medieval society.\\nBlacksmiths were considered to be skilled artisans, and their work was essential to the functioning of medieval society.\\nMedieval blacksmithing techniques',\n",
       " 'Medieval blacksmiths used a variety of techniques to create metal objects.\\nOne of the most common techniques was forging.\\nForging is the process of heating metal until it is soft enough to be shaped with a hammer and anvil.\\nAnother common technique was welding.\\nWelding is the process of joining two pieces of metal together by heating them until they melt and then hammering them together.\\nBlacksmiths also used a variety of other techniques, such as casting, cutting, and filing.\\nThe original fuel for forge fires was charcoal.\\nCoal did not begin to replace charcoal until the forests of first Britain (during the AD 17th century), and then the eastern United States of America (during the 19th century) were largely depleted.\\nCoal can be an inferior fuel for blacksmithing, because much of the world\\'s coal is contaminated with sulfur.\\nSulfur contamination of iron and steel make them \"red short\", so that at red heat they become \"crumbly\" instead of \"plastic\".\\nCoal sold and purchased for blacksmithing should be largely free of sulfur.\\nEuropean blacksmiths before and through the medieval era spent a great deal of time heating and hammering iron before forging it into finished articles.\\nAlthough they were unaware of the chemical basis, they were aware that the quality of the iron was thus improved.\\nFrom a scientific point of view, the reducing atmosphere of the forge was both removing oxygen (rust), and soaking more carbon into the iron, thereby developing increasingly higher grades of steel as the process was continued.\\nIndustrial era \\nDuring the eighteenth century, agents for the Sheffield cutlery industry scoured the British country-side, offering new carriage springs for old.\\nSprings must be made of hardened steel.\\nAt this time, the processes for making steel produced an extremely variable product—quality was not ensured at the initial point of sale.\\nSprings that had survived cracking through hard use over the rough roads of the time, had proven to be of a better quality steel.\\nMuch of the fame of Sheffield cutlery (knives, shears, etc.)\\nwas due to the extreme lengths the companies took to ensure they used high-grade steel.\\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, the US government included in their treaties with many Native American tribes, that the US would employ blacksmiths and strikers at Army forts, with the expressed purpose of providing Native Americans with iron tools and repair services.\\nDuring the early to mid-nineteenth century, both European armies<ref>An Aide-Memoire to the Military Sciences volume 1 by Royal Engineers, British Service, 1845, Col. G.G.\\nLewis, senior editor</ref> as well as both the U.S. Federal and Confederate armies employed blacksmiths to shoe horses and repair equipment such as wagons, horse tack, and artillery equipment.\\nThese smiths primarily worked at a traveling forge that when combined with a limber, comprised wagons specifically designed and constructed as blacksmith shops on wheels to carry the essential equipment necessary for their work.# The ordnance manual for the use of officers of the United States army, 1861, reprinted by Scholarly Publishing Office, University of Michigan Library, December 22, 2005,',\n",

       " 'The Shining \\nBefore making The Shining, Kubrick directed the film Barry Lyndon (1975), a highly visual period film about an Irishman who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy.\\nDespite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow.\\nKubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndons lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling.\\nStephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick\\'s secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages.\\nFinally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer\\'s work biting the dust.\\nShe walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining\".\\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there\\'s something inherently wrong with the human personality.\\nThere\\'s an evil side to it.\\nOne of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".\\nNicholson was Kubrick\\'s first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month), Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King\\'s disapproval.\\nIn his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period.\\nThese cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson\\'s and Shelley Duvall\\'s speech patterns.\\nHaving chosen King\\'s novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England.\\nSome of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.\\nTo enable him to shoot the scenes in chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production.\\nThe set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel.\\nIn February 1979, the set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production.\\nDoctor Sleep \\nWarner Bros. Pictures began developing a film adaptation of Doctor Sleep as early as 2014.\\nIn 2016, filmmaker Akiva Goldsman was attached to write and produce the film for Warner Bros. For several years, Warner Bros. could not secure a budget for Doctor Sleep, or for a different project, a prequel to The Shining called Overlook Hotel.\\nIn late 2017, Warner Bros. released It, a film adaptation of King\\'s 1986 novel of the same name, and its box office success led the studio to fast track production of Doctor Sleep.\\nIn January 2018, Warner Bros. hired Mike Flanagan to rewrite Goldsman\\'s script and direct the film, with Goldsman receiving executive producer credit.\\nOn why he was interested in directing Doctor Sleep, Flanagan explained: \"It touches on themes that are the most attractive to me, which are childhood trauma leading into adulthood, addiction, the breakdown of a family, and the after effects, decades later\".\\nFrom June to November, the cast was assembled.\\nFilming began in September in the U.S. state of Georgia; locations included Atlanta and St. Simons.\\nIn the area of Atlanta, specific locations included Covington, Canton, Stone Mountain, Midtown, Porterdale, and Fayetteville.\\nProduction concluded in December.\\nThe film score was composed by The Newton Brothers (Andy Grush and Taylor Stewart), who also composed scores for Flanagan\\'s previous works.\\nWaterTower Music has released the film score.\\nTelevision',\n",

J.

Kanor.\\nLiro, Dyesebel's childhood friend, was killed after taking a bullet for her.\\nThe loss of a loyal soldier pushed Dyesebel to make a desperate plea to stop the fighting, this time by physically tackling the warring sides and putting herself in harm's way.\\nWhen Coralia, Dyangga's daughter who had bullied Dyesebel as a child, was caught in the sight of a human soldier, Dyesebel did not hesitate to plunge into the water to save her from a gunshot.\\nDyangga, captured by humans, could only look on as the mermaid she has hated for so long took a bullet for her daughter.\\nFor Dyesebel, it was the ultimate sacrifice—risking her life for the same family who had plotted the assassination of her father, Tino, to seize his throne.\\nDyesebel's sacrifice silences the opposing groups, and both men and mermen, carry Dyesebel towards the hospital.\\nWith Dyesebel in critical condition, her human mother, Lucia, made a televised appeal to put an end to the war before there are any more casualties on either side.\\nAfter an apparent jump in time, Dyesebel was seen swimming in her kingdom and, later, freely walking on land—a sign that a truce between humans and mermaids had finally been reached.\\nHere, she was welcomed by Lucia and Fredo, as well as a little girl who appeared to be her own.\\nDifferences from the original story\",\n",

Snoeyenbos, while working for General Motors Corporation, revised the design of the air caster, and filed a patent for a “reversible air bearing support”.\\nGeneral Motors Corporation manufactured air casters, or “air bearings” for several years, then sold the rights to Snoeyenbos, who moved to Decatur, Illinois to found Airfloat.\\nHe launched his company from his brother's manufacturing shop in 1964, and officially incorporated as the Airfloat Corp in 1967.\\nReferences\",\n",

In 2017, close to 3,800 Danish Muslims were converts to the religion.\\nAccording to a survey by Aarhus University, the number of mosques is on a steady upward trajectory, rising from 115 in 2006 to 161 in 2017 —an increase of 40%.\\nHistory\\nDanish historian Jørgen Bæk Simonsen documents that encounters between Denmark and the Muslim world date back to the Middle Ages, when the Danish military participated in the Crusades to take control of Jerusalem from Muslim rule.\\nKing Frederick V of Denmark also travelled to South Arabia to collect information, plants, and artifacts.\\nAmong his co-voyagers was Carsten Niebuhr who observed and noted the customs of the region.\\nOne of the first Danish converts to Islam was Knud Holmboe, a journalist and writer of Desert Encounter, in which he detailed his first-hand account of the Libyan Genocide.\\nAn 1880 Danish census recorded 8 \"Mohammadans\" in the country.\\nCensuses continued to be carried out until 1970.\\nLarge-scale immigration from Muslim countries began in the 1950s.\\nDue to the expansion of Denmark\\'s post-war economy and increase in industrialization in the 1950-1960s, a large number of immigrants migrated to the country from the highly-Muslim populated nations of Yugoslavia, Turkey, Pakistan, and North Africa.\\nThis period was the first wave of large-scale Muslim immigration to Denmark.\\nThe first purpose-built mosques belonged to Ahmadi Muslims and was constructed in 1967.\\nIn 1973, the Danish government stopped free migration to the country.\\nRules were laxed in 1974 so that people with family in Denmark, people marrying someone in Denmark, or people seeking asylum could come to the country.\\nIn the 1980s, a second wave of Muslims immigrated to Denmark, mainly from Iran, the Middle East, and Africa.\\nMany of these immigrants were seeking political asylum.\\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution of Denmark, but the Church of Denmark enjoys certain privileges such as state subsidies that other religious groups in the country do not.\\nAs of 2013, 23 different Muslim communities are recognized as \"acknowledged religious communities\", giving them certain tax benefits.\\n2000s \\nThe asylum seekers comprise about 40% of the Danish Muslim population.\\nAccording to a survey conducted in the mid 2000s on mosques in Denmark, there were about 115 mosques in Denmark.\\nOf these, about 105 were Sunni Muslim, with most others following the Shia branch.\\nIt was found that there were about 30 imams on work visas active in Denmark from abroad and most of these were sent by the Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) agency.\\nAs a general rule, Friday prayers were not conducted in Danish but in the native tongues of the congregation.\\n2010s \\nIn 2014, halal slaughter without electrical stunning was banned in Denmark, citing animal welfare concerns.\\nIn February 2016, the Mariam mosque in Copenhagen, Denmark\\'s first female-run mosque, was founded by Sherin Khankan; it has only female imams.\\nThe mosque is open to male and female worshippers, with the exception of Friday prayers, which are only open to female worshippers.\\nKhankan became Scandinavia\\'s first female imam when she opened that mosque.\\nIn August 2017, two imams, one of which is the head of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Australia, were added to the Danish list of hate preachers, which meant they could not enter Denmark, bringing the total to ten.\\nIn autumn 2017, the Danish parliament (Danish: Folketinget) agreed to adopt a law prohibiting people to wear \"attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability\".\\nA full ban on both niqabs and burqas was announced on 31 May 2018.\\nThe ban came into force on 1 August 2018 and carries a fine of 1000 DKK (about 134 euros); with repeat offending, the fine may reach 10 000 DKK.\\nIt targets all garments that cover the face, such as fake beards or balaclavas.\\nSupporters of the ban claim that the ban facilitates integration of Muslims into Danish society, while Amnesty International claimed the ban violated women\\'s rights.\\nA protest numbering 300-400 people was held in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen, organised by the Socialist Youth Front, Kvinder i Dialog and Party Rebels.\\nAccording to a 2017 survey, there was an increase in the number of mosques in Denmark from 115 in 2006 to about 170 in 2017, which represented an increase of almost 50%.\\nThis increase corresponded roughly to the increasing numbers of Muslims in the country, which had risen from 200,000 to about 300,000.\\nAccording to polls among Muslims in Denmark conducted in 2006 and 2018, religiosity shows an escalation over time; whereas 37% prayed five times a day in 2006, by 2018 this number had increased to 50%.\\nThis was contrary to expectations that Muslims had been expected to conform to mainstream Danish society, where not many people are not particularly devoted to religion.\\nThe possible cause of the trend, according to sociologist Brian Arly Jacobsen at Copenhagen University, was the construction of 20-30 new mosques in the intervening 10 years.\\nIn April 2019, riots broke out in Nørrebro in Copenhagen, Denmark, after Islam critic Rasmus Paludan staged a demonstration in the district.\\n23 people were arrested for a range of offences, from refusal to obey commands issued by police to arson and violence against police.\\nEmergency services responded to 70 fires connected to the disturbances.\\n2020s \\nIn March 2021, legislation banned antidemocratic donations to recipients in Denmark, which according to Immigration minister Mattias Tesfaye was due to there being extremist movements abroad which are trying to turn Muslims against Denmark and undermining core values of Danish society.\\nThe legislation was prompted by media reports of millions being donated to mosques in Denmark having received millions in donations from the Middle East.\\nDemographics',\n",

mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) is a species of North American cyprinid freshwater fish in the genus Notropis.\\nThe genus Notropis is commonly known as the eastern shiners.\\nIt is native to areas of the Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, much of the Mississippi River basin including areas of Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and regions of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas.\\nHowever, this particular species can be found in other places such as the Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut and Housatonic rivers.\\nThis genus is usually characterized by almost all having a complete lateral line, 8 dorsal fin rays, a premaxillae protactile, and a silvery or speckled peritoneum.\\nAs the common name indicates, this species is difficult to classify in the wild because it looks similar to many other shiners.\\nIn fact, some even hypothesize that this species is actually a complexity of many cryptic species.\\nWhile this is the case, it is important to take more caution to not misidentify this species and to understand its impact on introduced areas.\\nThe diet of N. volucellus consists of some terrestrial insects, small crustaceans, and midge pupae and larvae.\\nMimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years, and are suspected to reach sexual maturity after one year.\\nIn lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants.\\nWhen found in small streams N. volucellus are generally in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes.\\nThe diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer.\\nThis fish is suspected to have been introduced to many areas via bait bucket release.\\nBecause negative impacts of the introduction of this species have not been documented and because this species is not listed as threatened, there is not much immediate need for conservation efforts of this species.\\nDistribution\\nHistorically, this species has been mostly found in the southern Hudson Bay drainage, Great Lakes drainage, and much of Mississippi River basin except in the northern Great Plains region and is oddly missing from many of its tributaries.\\nThe mimic shiner is also in Atlantic Coast drainage in Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, and Housatonic rivers along with the region of the Gulf of Mexico extending from Mobile Bay to the drainage of Texas.\\nHowever, currently this species can also be found in Susquehanna River, drainage in New York, Potomac River, East Branch of the Delaware River collected in 2002, Connecticut River drainage of Massachusetts, low altitude, Connecticut regions such as Westhill Pond, upper Nashua drainage of Massachusetts, Housatonic River drainage in Massachusetts.\\nIt is suspected that the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas may be due to a change in hydraulic regimes due to fragmentation of landscapes along with urbanization and development.\\nDue to fragmentation of the landscape near or around riverine ecosystems, there is less available vegetation along these areas.\\nWith less vegetation, a faster flow of water pours into streams and rivers and possibly causes erosion to its banks.\\nThis influx of water and higher velocity of flow could have negative impacts on this species that lives in areas that has a relatively slow to moderate current.\\nEcology\\nNotropis volucellus can generally be found in sandy pools of headwaters, creeks, clear small to large rivers, and in quiet areas of lakes while avoiding small, headwater streams, and swampy and marshy areas.\\nIn small streams N. volucellus are in clear pools over gravel substrate in moderate current but they can be seen along shorelines over gravel, sand, and mud substrates usually in slow to moderate current when found in large lakes.\\nWhen monitoring one most often will find mimic shiners near riffles in current and often will find them schooling in mid-water or at the surface of water.\\nBecause this is a small fish, mimic shiners have many piscivorous predators that are bigger in size.\\nSuch predators include northern pike walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, rock bass, and brown bullhead among others.\\nThe diet of N. volucellus consists mostly of Daphnia in early spring and late fall while mostly small crustaceans, filamentous algae, and small invertebrates when Daphnia is not as abundant in the summer.\\nOne study showed that Daphnia was present in 85% of all stomachs sampled and zooplankton  (copepods and Chydorus) was found in greater than 30% of stomach samples in August.\\nFish aged at 0 ate mostly Chydorus, but in the summer were found to eat varying amounts of invertebrates like small leeches and some chironomids.\\nAt age 2, mimic shiners were found to eat other invertebrates than those stated after May while their diet consisted of 50-80% filamentous algae in September and early October but less than 50% at other times.\\nIn this study no other large fish populations, except for some centrarchids, were found that would compete for Daphnia as a food source.\\nDue to pollution from humans, many fish have been observed to bioaccumulate mercury.\\nWhile effects of bioaccumulation are mostly studied in the larger piscivores, they can also be observed in smaller prey such as theNotropis volucellus.\\nA rise in mercury levels in water could cause the disappearance of mimic shiners in some areas.\\nLife history\\nMimic shiners are reported to only live a total of three years.\\nThis species, at least documented in TN, reach sexual maturity after their first year of growth.\\nSpawning of this species varies depending on different locations due to differences in seasons and temperature changes.\\nIn Minnesota and Wisconsin this occurs from May to August while in Alabama this event occurs from mid-April to early August.\\nHowever, because males produce nuptial tubercles from late May to early October in Tennessee, it is suggested that Notropis volucellus have a longer breeding season than other areas which peak in the summer.\\nIn lakes, fish spawn in large schools located over beds of aquatic plants.\\nIn streams, however, spawning location has not yet been documented.\\nClutch sizes increases per female with an increase in body size, ranging from 74 to 386 oocytes produced from body sizes ranging from .\\nThese fertilized eggs are demersal and adhesive.\\nBecause spawning varies depending on varying seasons and temperature changes, it is not unimaginable to predict changes in spawning due to global temperature changes in the future.\\nAs of yet, there has not been much research regarding Notropis volucellus.\\nAs stated before, human-caused development and deforestation around the areas alter current of streams and also alter turbidity.\\nAlso stated above, the mimic shiner breeds in areas that are clear, has little current, and contains vegetation.\\nChanges in the hydraulic regime of the habitats mimic shiners live in could create unfavorable conditions to reproduce.\\nCurrent management\\nSome places do claim that this species has declined significantly in certain areas.\\nThe department of Natural Resources of Ohio state that the mimic shiner was once found all over Ohio, but it is now not as abundant in many places as it used to be.\\nIn table 2 of a paper discussing effects of landscape change on fish abundances, the mimic shiner is also listed as intolerant to disturbances and thus has been decreasing in number.\\nHowever, many other regions believe this fish to be invasive.\\nThe mimic shiner is suspected to have been introduced into many regions.\\nThe source is believed to be the spread via the sport of fishing.\\nIt is reported, though not commonly sold in stores as such, mimic shiners were used in vast quantities as bait in Wisconsin lake and were even used as a primary source for food for fishes at one hatchery.\\nNot much is being done to protect this specific species nor are many groups focusing on the mimic shiner.\\nThis is not unusual seeing how it is not listed as needing protection according to the IUCN red list of threatened species the population of Notropis volucellus is stable and its conservation status is of least concern.\\nWhile pollution and dams are a major problem or water ecosystems, this fish has not been reported to need assistance in respects to conservation.\\nInstead of needing protection, they need to be prevented from being introduced into non-native areas.\\nIt is likely that they could cause disruption to their non-native introduced ranges due to competition for resources.\\nReferences',\n",

       " 'Proposals to change or eliminate tenure\\nSeveral states are looking into changing (in the name of reforming) and even eliminating their teacher tenure system.\\nSome of the states leading the movement include Florida, New Jersey, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania.\\nMany would also like to see teachers being evaluated based on their performance and their students\\' academic achievement.\\nIn eight states in America, tenure is given to teachers after just two years of teaching during the probation period.\\nIn two states, tenure is awarded after only one year of teaching during the probation period.\\nWashington DC does not require a  set time for awarding tenure.\\nSupporters of this notion feel that one or two years is too short a time to tell if a teacher is having a positive effect on their students.\\nBefore these teachers are granted lifetime job protection, they would like to see them perform on probation for a longer period of time.\\nChanges have been created in all forms.\\nSome proposals call for longer probation periods while others call for stricter teacher evaluations.\\nOther proposals wish to end the tenure system completely and replace this system with renewable contracts.\\nKey actors\\nFormer New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed to (as he called it) reform the tenure system in New Jersey.\\nHe wished to eliminate the current tenure system and replace it with a new one.\\nCurrently in New Jersey, after a teacher proves themselves efficient for 3 years, they gain lifetime protection under tenure.\\nChristie\\'s proposal would also see teachers prove themselves for three years to gain tenure.\\nHowever, after one year of being deemed \"ineffective\", teachers could easily be fired under his scheme.\\nChristie wanted to judge whether a teacher is ineffective or not on a two part assessment.\\nOne part of the score will be based on student achievement.\\nThe second part of the score will be based on teacher performance.\\nChristie believes the answer to making schools more effective is to place more accountability on teachers.\\nChristie stated, \"Let New Jersey lead the way again,\", \"The time to eliminate teacher tenure is now.\"\\nFormer chancellor of DC public schools, Michelle Rhee, had made plans to eliminate teacher tenure altogether.\\nRhee designed a pay plan which would compensate teachers by giving them big pay raises in exchange for their tenure protection rights.\\nShe gave existing tenured teachers the choice to accept this proposal.\\nNew hires would be forced to accept this new pay plan.\\nNew hires would be paid on the basis of their students\\' achievement.\\nWhile teachers would prospectively be able to make more money under this pay plan, they would not be granted any tenure protections.\\nRhee\\'s plan was unsuccessful.\\nTeachers did not want to give up their tenure protections for a higher salary.\\nAfter this plan failed she continued to devise plans.\\nShe offered a buyout plan for existing teachers with tenure.\\nIn 2009, she created a plan called IMPACT.\\nThis plan tied students performance on state tests to teachers evaluation.\\nWhile this plan gained the support of many, there were still many others who opposed it.\\nAgainst changes in the tenure system\\nIn some states, schools are required to pay more to teachers who have earned higher degrees, and tenure allows teachers to secure a job, go back to school, and return to their jobs, not fearing dismissal because of their higher pay grade.\\nSupporters liken tenure to the concept of seniority in other jobs.\\nTeachers are often forced into uncomfortable situations (such as failing students, choosing certain students).\\nAn employee who makes decisions of a difficult and confrontational nature would thus require job protection.\\nMany who are against the motion of reforming/eliminating tenure argue that tenure allows teaching to become a profession rather than just a job.\\nPresumably, teachers would not have as much job stability and would be forced to transfer from school to school.\\nGiving teachers permanent positions would allow them to form bonds and relationships with students, parents, and other faculty.\\nRecent activity\\nSeveral jurisdictions have considered changes in their tenure system since the 1990s.\\nSome of these states include:\\nCalifornia  has seen many attempts to change their tenure system.\\nOne of the more recent attempts was made by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in January 2005.\\nHe tried to pass an act (Excellence in Teaching Act) which would pay teachers on the basis of their performance.\\nHe also wanted to enact the \"Put the Kids First Act\" which would extend the probation period of teachers to five years (it is currently two years).\\nThis act would also allow a school to fire teachers after two unsatisfactory ratings.\\nThe school would no longer have to give the teacher 90 days to improve their performance before being fired.\\nThis stirred up much controversy among the teachers in California.\\nThe act was voted on and was never passed.\\nFlorida- In 1997 a major movement toward changing tenure took place, which its proponents considered a success.\\nThis change reduced the probationary period a teacher worked to achieve tenure to 97 days instead of a year.\\nDuring those 97 days, a teacher could be fired without just cause.\\nOnly 101 of Florida\\'s 10,689 new teachers were dismissed by the school in 1998.\\nWhile this reform was considered a success by some, teacher unions stepped in and won back many protections.\\nIn 2009, a new plan was proposed.\\nLegislators wished to get rid of tenure for all new teachers.\\nTenure would be replaced with yearly renewable contracts.\\nAfter ten years, a teacher would be eligible for renewable contracts which would last up to five years.\\nThis plan was never passed by the Senate.\\nNew York-  In 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg voiced his concern that although teachers could be let go easily during the three year probation period, they hardly ever were.\\nIn 2008, Bloomberg introduced the Principal Portal.\\nThis was a tool that principals would use to help evaluate their teachers.\\nIt gave them guidelines to follow and base their decisions on.\\nThe number of teachers let go during their probation period doubled in the first year under the Principal Portal.\\nBloomberg also wished to have students test scores incorporated in the tenure process.\\nSee also\\n StudentsFirst\\n

M. Neumann and Axel A. Weber alongside Jens Weidmann, among others.\\nCareer in the public sector\\nAfter two years (1994–96) at the  in Cologne, Asmussen held a succession of positions in the German Federal Ministry of Finance.\\nAs a financial advisor of the coalition government 2005–2009 and as the Finance Ministry\\'s representative for  True Sale International, an association of banks and financial service interest groups in Germany, Asmussen supported bank deregulation and an extension of the market of asset-backed securities (ABSs).\\nSome sources highlighted his role in the run up to financial crisis of 2007.\\nWhilst at the Ministry, Asmussen was responsible for  the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) at the time when the Düsseldorf based IKB Deutsche Industriebank had to be restructured – mainly due to ABS investments.\\nAsmussen was member of the supervisory board of that bank at that time (2007).\\nState Secretary at the German Federal Ministry of Finance, 2008–11\\nFrom 2008 to 2011, Asmussen was State Secretary at the Ministry led by Wolfgang Schäuble, responsible for the Directorate\\'s fiscal policy and macroeconomic affairs, financial market policy and European policy.\\nHe led the country\\'s crisis management team following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\\nHe later became a central figure in negotiations with other euro zone countries on how to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.\\nDuring his time in office, Asmussen also served as chairman of the Administrative Council of Germany\\'s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin); chairman of the inter-ministerial steering committee of the Financial Market Stabilisation Authority (FMSA); member of the Financial Stability Board (FSF); and board member of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).\\nIn addition, he served on the supervisory boards of Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).\\nIn May 2011, Asmussen – acting on behalf the German government – endorsed deploying the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through loans to business in the Middle East, under the condition that countries make “a firm commitment to the core principles of democracy, political pluralism and the market economy.” At the time, the EBRD was led by fellow German Social Democrat Thomas Mirow and pushing to extend its mandate to North Africa as part of a larger effort by Europe and the United States to help countries in the region during the Arab Spring.\\nOn 7 June 2011 Asmussen attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.\\nIn November 2011, Asmussen served as Chancellor Merkel\\'s acting Sherpa to the G20 summit.\\nExecutive Board of the European Central Bank, 2012–14\\nIn January 2012,  Asmussen was appointed to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank under the leadership of President Mario Draghi, succeeding Jürgen Stark who had resigned because of his dismay over central bank bond-buying.\\nThe selection of Asmussen was announced at the meeting of Group of 7 countries in Marseille, France.\\nAt the time, his nomination was controversial in the German parliament, where members of the parties in chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right coalition – Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party – expressed skepticism because he was known to be a member of the then-opposition Social Democratic party.\\nOriginally rumoured to be appointed to serve as chief economist of the ECB,—a position for which French ECB board member Benoît Cœuré was also a candidate—Asmussen was instead given responsibility for International and European Relations on the board, which Draghi has expanded to include attending, alongside himself, meetings of Eurozone government leaders and finance ministers.\\nBelgian Peter Praet was given responsibility for the Economics department.\\nSome saw the debate around this appointment as highly controversial, when questions were asked about the North-South balance in the ECB\\'s governing structure.\\nThroughout his tenure, Asmussen often helped communicate policy to – as New York Times described it – a German public fearful that the ECB was a conduit for transferring their wealth to stricken countries like Greece.\\nIn German media, he was publicly supportive of bank measures to subdue the euro zone crisis that were unpopular in Germany.\\nIn doing so, he presented a counterweight to officials like Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, who were highly critical of the ECB.\\nIn June 2013, Asmussen defended ECB policies in testimony to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany after citizens’ groups challenged their constitutionality.\\nAsmussen and Weidmann gave opposing evidence to the German Constitutional Court this year in a hearing to determine the legality of the Outright Monetary Transactions program.\\nCountering Weidmann\\'s testimony, Asmussen argued the OMT program did not relieve countries of the need to reform their own economies as they would have to sign up to rescue plans monitored by the EU\\'s bailout fund, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.\\nWhile Weidmann argued that bond markets exert discipline on countries’ finances, Asmussen said the euro area faced break-up last year as investors began to price in an end to the currency.\\nIn early 2013, Asmussen represented the ECB in talks with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund over aid to Cyprus, a member of the euro zone.\\nThey worked out a plan that would have forced depositors to finance much of a bailout of the country\\'s banks.\\nAfter an outcry, they revised the plan.\\nDraghi later called the plan “not smart,” an implicit rebuke to Asmussen.\\nAsmussen\\'s term at the ECB was scheduled to run until 2019.\\nHowever, he resigned from his post to join German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government in December 2013, saying he wanted to spend more time with his partner and two young children in Berlin.\\nAt the time, he was mentioned in the media as a possible finance minister if the SPD had managed to grasp control of the ministry from incumbent Wolfgang Schäuble in the negotiations on a coalition government following the 2013 elections.\\nState Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, 2014–16\\nIn his position as State Secretary under Labor Minister Andrea Nahles, Asmussen oversaw the introduction of a national minimum wage.\\nDuring a 2015 conference in Berlin, Asmussen held that \"the core of European integration for the future is the eurozone\" and argued in favor of \"a deeper federal integration of the eurozone, which would mean gradually creating new institutions such as an EU finance ministry or a eurozone budget.\"\\nIn late 2015, Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble reached agreement on Asmussen moving to a managerial position at Germany\\'s state development bank KfW, which ultimately did not happen due to a disagreement with the KfW management.\\nCareer in the private sector\\nUpon leaving politics, Amussen has taken on numerous positions on corporate boards, including the following: \\n Funding Circle, non-executive director of
